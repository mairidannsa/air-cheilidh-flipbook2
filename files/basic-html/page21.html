                                    %u00c0dhamh D%u00e0maireach | Adam Dahmer and K.C. Beaton. Both spoke of the importance of language in Gaelic community creation, with K.C. describing it as the warp onto which the complimenting threads of culture are woven. %u00c0dhamh, who hails from Kentucky, took us to a moment when he was a student staying in the traditional Gaelic community of Flodigarry in the north of the Isle of Skye. Singing songs with other Gaels there, learners and native speakers alike, gave him a strong sense of community. %u201cAll of us [were] together in the hall of this hostel with people from all over the world,%u201d he remembered. %u201cAnd I remember we joined in the chorus of %u2018M%u00f2rag of Dun Bheagan%u2019%u201d%u2014he sang the chorus %u2014%u201cfor some of us, that%u2019s all we could manage of the song, but by God we had that part, and we were belting it! And I thought to myself, well this is just wonderful.%u201d Later, somewhat to his surprise, %u00c0dhamhexperienced the same feeling in his home state of Kentucky when he led others in singing the same song in a pub. He felt a deep satisfaction that he had managed to recreate something of that special moment in Flodigarry for his %u201chome crowd%u201d across the ocean. %u201cThat was a very satisfying moment. I want everybody to have a moment like that%u2014where they find something they enjoy and are ableto recreate it for other people.%u201dWhere Gaelic livesThe contexts in which Gaelic is naturally spoken have changed significantly over the past century. For many, their opportunities to speak the language are often concentrated around private visits, language classes or Gaelic cultural events such as dances, concerts and milling frolics. But what about other %u201cthird spaces,%u201d as they%u2019re sometimes called, such as the library, the gym, the sports field etc.? In Season 1, Session 3, Host Iain MacLeod began by talking about his work as a storyteller and filmmaker, and his curiosity around the narratives we tell ourselves and each other. He explained how his parents were persuaded into a colonial narrative that mandated people to speak English and warned that speaking Gaelic would at worst hold you back and at best simply be irrelevant to anyone living outside of the most traditional of rural G%u00e0idhealtachd areas. From this, Iain had internalized a perspective that unless he was going to move to a croft in North Uist there was nowhere the language could fit into his life. For the following hour he and visitors on the call set about re-authoring this narrative and exploring the different spaces where Gaelic can live, thrive and foster connection.Scottish football (soccer) players Donnie Forbes and Calum Fergusson spoke of their organization, FC Sonas, which offers Gaelic language instruction and encouragement alongside sports training. %u201cThe beauty of sports is that it adds a fun element, where you don't realize you are using the language,%u201d said Calum. In Scotland, children often associate the language with school, so social outlets are important, so the language thrives in community. %u201cWe have an opportunity to use football and Gaelic as a catalyst for social change within the community,%u201d said Donnie.Gr%u00e1inne N%u00ed Fhoighil of Connemara, Ireland, said it was natural for her to do her activities in Gaeilge | Irish Gaelic, but teaching mindfulness to children was a new subject, requiring new vocabulary. As she travelled to different communities, she found that the children were not only eager to learn the yoga and mindfulness practices she was teaching, but that they were also excited to share their own dialects%u2019 words for the feelings and sensations associated with them. %u201cI found that really exciting,%u201dshe said. %u201cThere was a richness scattered around,and this was one way of collecting it together.%u201dMeanwhile, Seoige NicDh%u00f2mhnuill | Joyce MacDonald spoke of the motivation and camaraderie which had developed through the Gaelic writers%u2019 group she set up. Being able to combine Gaelic with an existing or developing passion felt deeply nourishing and inspiring andhelped to course-correct the limiting belief that Gaelic is only relevant in certain contexts. The narrative which emerged from this session, and others, was that Gaelic can thrive in all kinds of geographical neighborhoods and communities 16
