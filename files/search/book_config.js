Between \u000d\u000a2020 and 2024, this project hosted four seasons of \u000d\u000aonline and in-person gatherings to explore and \u000d\u000acelebrate Gaelic culture and community in Nova \u000d\u000aScotia and beyond. As one of the project\u2019s hosts, \u000d\u000aBernadette Campbell described it: \u201cThe purpose of \u000d\u000athe Gaelic Narrative Project is to create a dignified, \u000d\u000awelcoming and playful space where we share \u000d\u000amoments and stories that speak to our connection \u000d\u000ato Gaelic language, to culture and the community\u201d \u000d\u000a(Season 2, Session 1).\u000d\u000aThe Gaelic Narrative Project grew from the \u000d\u000anurturing soil of How We Thrive, an organisation \u000d\u000afounded by Susan Szpakowski in 2018 to support \u000d\u000aconnection, conversation, resilience and joy \u000d\u000aamong Nova Scotia\u2019s diverse communities. How \u000d\u000aWe Thrive is guided by the principles of reauthoring, a technique used in narrative therapy \u000d\u000awhich harnesses the transformational power of \u000d\u000astorytelling in shaping and enhancing our lives. \u000d\u000aNarrative coach and consultant Chen\u00e9 Swart \u000d\u000aoffered influential guidance in the early \u000d\u000adevelopment of How We Thrive and her work \u000d\u000aechoes throughout the Gaelic Narrative Project.\u000d\u000aIn one online session for How We Thrive in April \u000d\u000a2020, Chen\u00e9 commented how \u201cthe re-authoring \u000d\u000apractices are like a good meal\u2014you have to taste \u000d\u000ait, to have a sense of the work.\u201d This little book \u000d\u000atries to give a blasad beag | a little taste of the rich \u000d\u000athoughts and conversations which were laid out \u000d\u000aon the feasting table during the Gaelic Narrative \u000d\u000aProject sessions. We begin with some background \u000d\u000aof how the Gaelic Narrative Project came into \u000d\u000abeing before moving into thematic explorations of \u000d\u000athe conversations we shared during the sessions.\u000d\u000aAs editor and compiler, I had the privilege of\u000d\u000areturning to this feasting table again and again, \u000d\u000alistening to the recordings and letting all the \u000d\u000astories, images and conversations settle into the \u000d\u000athemes that stood out for me. These themes \u000d\u000abecame chapter titles, or baskets, which I then \u000d\u000afilled with \u201cmoments\u201d from all the sessions.\u000d\u000aThis is by no means an exhaustive summary of \u000d\u000athe sessions, or a list of all that is important to the \u000d\u000aGaels of Nova Scotia. Re-authoring isn\u2019t meant to \u000d\u000alead to a single narrative or a hierarchy of \u000d\u000amoments. Each person will take their own \u000d\u000amorsels, their own memories, from the feasting \u000d\u000atable. After browsing through these chapters, I \u000d\u000ainvite you to visit the original recordings and \u000d\u000asummaries, which are available on the How We \u000d\u000aThrive website and linked throughout the \u000d\u000achapters. Additional references and resources are \u000d\u000aoffered in the Appendix. \u000d\u000aI hope the following chapters inspire you to host \u000d\u000avisits in your own community, as a way of coauthoring new stories about what is important to \u000d\u000ayou and your guests in these changing and often \u000d\u000achallenging times. \u000d\u000aGun t\u00e9id gu math leibh!\u000d\u000aM\u00e0iri Britton\u000d\u000aAn Drochaid | Mabou, April 2025\u000d\u000a1","1. Ath-sgeulachadh | Re-storying\u000d\u000a\u201cTake us to a moment\u2026\u201d\u000d\u000aThere\u2019s often a moment, isn\u2019t there? Maybe you \u000d\u000asensed it as it happened, or maybe the awareness \u000d\u000acomes with hindsight, but either way you realise it \u000d\u000awas the start of something significant.\u000d\u000aIn June 2018, a special blanket passed from the \u000d\u000ahands of its weaver \u00d2mar Bhochanan | Amber \u000d\u000aBuchanan, a young Gaelic woman from the North \u000d\u000aShore of Cape Breton, and into the hands of Ma\u2019git \u000d\u000aPoulette, an Elder from the Mi\u2019kmaw community \u000d\u000aof We'koqma'q. They were at the first How We \u000d\u000aThrive event in Halifax, organised and convened \u000d\u000aby a group of Nova Scotians. Chen\u00e9 Swart and \u000d\u000aSobaz Benjamin had co-led a module called \u000d\u000a\u201cShaping Our Future Through Stories\u201d where \u000d\u000aparticipants from Mi\u2019kmaq, Gaelic, African Nova \u000d\u000aScotian, newcomer and other communities had \u000d\u000acome together to deepen their sense of connection \u000d\u000athrough story-sharing. As the session drew to a\u000d\u000aclose Amber presented Ma\u2019git with the cloth from \u000d\u000aher loom. \u201cKnowing I was coming here and that I \u000d\u000awould meet my Mi\u2019kmaw neighbours,\u201d she said, \u201cI \u000d\u000aspun some yarn and wove this cloth in the five \u000d\u000acolours of the Medicine Wheel. I felt ashamed that \u000d\u000aI had grown up just down the road from your \u000d\u000acommunity but never really met any of these \u000d\u000aneighbours. I wanted to express my gratitude for \u000d\u000ahaving this chance to be together here, and to offer \u000d\u000ayou this gift.\u201d\u000d\u000aSusan Szpakowski remembers the significance of \u000d\u000athis exchange: \u201cThat moment was a gift to us all,\u201d \u000d\u000ashe wrote. \u201cLooking back, I realize that my passion \u000d\u000aabout narrative was fueled by a desire for more \u000d\u000amoments like this one. I was willing to commit \u000d\u000atime and energy to learning more about how such \u000d\u000amoments happen, what conditions are needed. \u000d\u000aBecause heaven knows we need more stories that \u000d\u000aacknowledge and begin to heal colonial wounds.\u201d \u000d\u000aThe seed for The Narrative Project had been \u000d\u000aplanted.\u000d\u000a\u00d2mar and Ma\u2019git at How We Thrive, 2018\u000d\u000aMade of stories\u000d\u000aTwo years later, following another rich in-person \u000d\u000agathering, Susan convened a team that would host \u000d\u000aa series of online conversations. These would \u000d\u000afeature facilitators and guests from around the \u000d\u000aAtlantic provinces who would explore narratives \u000d\u000athey wanted to \u201cre-author\u201d and those they wanted \u000d\u000ato celebrate. It was an eclectic group, and it \u000d\u000aworked. Susan remembers how \u201cnone of the rest \u000d\u000aof us would have thought of the stories that the \u000d\u000aothers brought forward. And so it was always \u000d\u000asurprising, and a little scary, and also beautiful.\u201d\u000d\u000aIt also couldn\u2019t have come at a better time. Just as \u000d\u000athe series was scheduled to start, making use of a \u000d\u000alittle-known online platform called Zoom, the \u000d\u000aworld ground to a halt as a result of the COVID-19 \u000d\u000apandemic. As people scrambled to adapt to the \u000d\u000achanges, traumas and boredom of lockdowns, the \u000d\u000aNarrative Project was ready to welcome them into \u000d\u000anourishing conversations which encouraged \u000d\u000astorytelling, sharing and deep, human connection, \u000d\u000aeven over the internet.\u000d\u000aFrangag Nic Eachainn | Frances MacEachen was \u000d\u000aworking for the Office of Gaelic Affairs in the Nova \u000d\u000aScotia Government and was a member of that first \u000d\u000a2","Narrative Project team. \u201cI remember those \u000d\u000asessions as being really inspirational,\u201d she said, \u000d\u000a\u201cbecause it was a diverse team of people from \u000d\u000adifferent regions.\u201d Frances hosted a session with \u000d\u000aMi\u2019kmaw elder and master basket-weaver Ma'lklit \u000d\u000a| Margaret Gould Pelletier and young Gael, Abaidh \u000d\u000aDh\u00f2mhnullach | Abigail MacDonald. Ma\u2019lklit spoke \u000d\u000aof how her family had lost their home during \u000d\u000aCentralization, when Mi\u2019kmaw communities were \u000d\u000aforcefully amalgamated into reserves like \u000d\u000aEskasoni in Cape Breton. She endured many \u000d\u000adifficult years in Residential School, but her \u000d\u000aparents\u2019 resilience and determination to pass on \u000d\u000atheir language and culture meant that she learned \u000d\u000aher mother tongue and ancestral skills such as \u000d\u000abasket weaving.\u000d\u000aDescended from Scottish Gaelic and Italian \u000d\u000aimmigrants, Abi is working hard to reclaim her \u000d\u000aancestral Gaelic language and is a talented \u000d\u000amusician and songwriter. She shared a song about \u000d\u000aher grandmother which she had written in Gaelic \u000d\u000awith her uncle, Goiridh D\u00f2mhnullach | Jeff \u000d\u000aMacDonald, who is a fluent Gaelic-speaker. \u000d\u000aFrances reflected on how ancestral gifts, both \u000d\u000abaskets and song-making, emerged organically as \u000d\u000athe central theme of the session, and how wellreceived it was by participants on the call. \u201cIt got \u000d\u000ame thinking, \u201cWe should do something for the \u000d\u000aGaelic community\u2019 . . . I was feeling we, as Gaels,\u000d\u000atend to be held back by our stories . . . so it would \u000d\u000abe helpful to unpack some of those and say, Are\u000d\u000athey true? Do they resonate with us? Are they \u000d\u000ahelpful? Are there other stories that we can choose?\u201d\u000d\u000aTaking time\u000d\u000aThis led to the first season of Air Ch\u00e9ilidh | the \u000d\u000aGaelic Narrative Project, which took place in \u000d\u000awinter 2021. A small team of hosts adapted How \u000d\u000aWe Thrive\u2019s 90-minute template structure which \u000d\u000aguided each session:\u000d\u000a~ Welcome with music\u000d\u000a~ 10 mins break-out room with groups of three (3 \u000d\u000amins each to talk)\u000d\u000a~ 35 mins conversation between host and guest\u000d\u000a~ 20 mins breakout group with groups of three \u000d\u000a(6 mins each to talk)\u000d\u000a~ Harvest \u2013 everyone typing reflections into the \u000d\u000achat\u000d\u000a~ Wrap up with music\u000d\u000aThe breakout rooms and harvest sharing were \u000d\u000acrucial aspects of the sessions. As Frances \u000d\u000acommented, \u201cThe more diversity and the more \u000d\u000astories in the room . . . [it] gives you greater insight \u000d\u000ainto a bigger story . . . It \u2018thickens\u2019 the narrative.\u201d \u000d\u000aEach person was encouraged to take their time \u000d\u000aand to use the full three or six minutes allotted to \u000d\u000athem to talk, or to allow silence until the words \u000d\u000acame. \u000d\u000aSusan added that \u201cwitnessing is so important. \u000d\u000aCollectively, you're honoring the quiet moment \u000d\u000athat that person has created for everyone and \u000d\u000aturning it around so that it is an opportunity and \u000d\u000anot any kind of failure that they didn't have their \u000d\u000awords together in time, or that someone else in the \u000d\u000agroup didn't jump in to help them.\u201d\u000d\u000aBringing this kind of mindfulness to the sessions \u000d\u000aallowed for moments of surprising insight. \u000d\u000aMichael White, one of the founders of the Dulwich \u000d\u000aCentre and a key thinker behind the concept of reauthoring, described a process he called \u000d\u000a\u201cexoticizing the domestic\u201d\u2014slowing down and \u000d\u000aconsidering the mundane in new ways until its \u000d\u000afamiliar contours shift into something quite \u000d\u000aremarkable. \u000d\u000a\u201cIn every session, we invite curiosity, listening and \u000d\u000asurprise,\u201d Susan explained. \u201cWe ask questions that \u000d\u000adon\u2019t have quick or easy answers.\u201d As a result, \u000d\u000a\u201csomething fresh always comes up, because the \u000d\u000aquestions invite you to just go to that first thought, \u000d\u000amemory, moment, feeling or impression, and \u000d\u000ashare that right on the spot. Often, the person \u000d\u000awho's telling the story learns as much about the \u000d\u000aquestion as the person who's listening. [It gets us] \u000d\u000aout of these thin, dominant, go-to, expedient \u000d\u000astories that keep us trapped in business as usual \u000d\u000aand thinking as usual and our identities as usual.\u201d\u000d\u000a3","Some guiding principles\u000d\u000aOne of the main hopes of this book is that it will\u000d\u000ainspire others to host more of these kinds of \u000d\u000aconversations. For those who are curious, here are \u000d\u000asome of the re-authoring principles that guided \u000d\u000athe sessions of Air Ch\u00e9ilidh:\u000d\u000a1. Create a clear plan for the gathering and\u000d\u000ameet in advance to discuss the theme,\u000d\u000aquestions and hosting roles.\u000d\u000a2. Include multiple opportunities for people\u000d\u000ato talk in small groups.\u000d\u000a3. Encourage people to share time equally\u000d\u000aand take their full allotted minutes.\u000d\u000a4. Ask open but focused questions: for\u000d\u000aexample, instead of saying \u201ctell me a story\u000d\u000aabout [x],\u201d you might say \u201ctake us to a\u000d\u000amoment when you felt [at home, peaceful,\u000d\u000aexcited, nourished etc.]\u201d\u000d\u000a5. Try not to offer judgment on what\u000d\u000asomeone has shared, even to praise it;\u000d\u000ainstead, share how it moved you, what it\u000d\u000aprompted you to think of etc.\u000d\u000aRe-authoring is about empowering ourselves as \u000d\u000aindividuals and community members to recognize \u000d\u000aour autonomy in shaping our own narratives. So \u000d\u000aoften, and especially among marginalized \u000d\u000acommunities, people inherit imposed narratives \u000d\u000afrom more dominant external voices: their culture \u000d\u000ais not economically viable, it is incompatible with \u000d\u000amodern life, people who speak that language are \u000d\u000a\u201cbackward\u201d etc. Over time, the legacy of shame or \u000d\u000aloss which those views instill can become \u000d\u000ainternalized, and so re-authoring offers an \u000d\u000aopportunity to sit down and examine them, to \u000d\u000adecide if we still want to carry them with us.\u000d\u000aDeparting from well-worn narratives and \u000d\u000apredictable identities can prompt all kinds of \u000d\u000asurprises, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re here for. The idea \u000d\u000ais to explore and play with ideas, not freeze \u000d\u000aanything in place or replace one fixed narrative \u000d\u000awith another. So let it breathe. Let it take your \u000d\u000abreath away. Let it fill you with curiosity and \u000d\u000apossibility.\u000d\u000a4","2. Aoigheachd | Hospitality\u000d\u000aF\u00e0ilt\u2019 is furan, ur beatha an taigh!\u000d\u000aWelcome and welcome, welcome into the house!\u000d\u000aThe name for the Gaelic Narrative Project, Air \u000d\u000aCh\u00e9ilidh, comes from one of the most central \u000d\u000ainstitutions of Gaelic culture, the c\u00e9ilidh or visit. \u000d\u000aHospitality is a deeply embedded value in Gaelic \u000d\u000aculture, reinforced and celebrated through \u000d\u000aproverbs, songs, stories and daily practices. It \u000d\u000acould be a cup of tea and neighbourly chat at the \u000d\u000akitchen table or a seven-hour story-telling session \u000d\u000aand house party to which most of the community \u000d\u000ashows up. Whatever the occasion, it has long been \u000d\u000aa Gaelic practice to greet strangers and friends \u000d\u000aalike with warmth and generosity, offering tea and \u000d\u000anourishment. \u000d\u000aGiving a good welcome is important, and it was a \u000d\u000acentral focus for us in hosting the Gaelic Narrative \u000d\u000aProject sessions as well. The hosts wanted guests \u000d\u000ato feel at ease as they arrived into the online \u000d\u000aspace\u2014like they were visiting, in a virtual kitchen. \u000d\u000aA key component of this was the break-out rooms \u000d\u000awhich allowed participants to share thoughts and \u000d\u000astories in small groups, of three or four, at least \u000d\u000atwice during each session. Many participants \u000d\u000acommented on how they appreciated \u201cconnecting \u000d\u000awith community, listening to the variety of \u000d\u000aspeakers sharing from their hearts, and being able \u000d\u000ato participate despite being so far away\u201d or how \u000d\u000athey were grateful for the \u201cencouragement and \u000d\u000ahospitality\u201d given to them.\u000d\u000aThe gifts of the visit\u000d\u000a\u201cRadical hospitality\u201d is something of a buzzword, \u000d\u000abut Season 3, Session 6 considered the ways in \u000d\u000awhich Gaels have been embodying this way of \u000d\u000abeing for generations. Host Kieran Walker was \u000d\u000ajoined by guests \u00d2mar Buchanan | Amber \u000d\u000aBuchanan and Te\u00e0rlach Wilson, themselves skilled \u000d\u000aand generous hosts in their working and day-today lives. This session considered and re-authored\u000d\u000aa modern narrative that no one has time for \u000d\u000ainformal visits these days, and that spontaneous \u000d\u000avisits, especially if they seem to put \u201cpressure\u201d on \u000d\u000athe host to provide refreshments, are an \u000d\u000aimposition. What emerged instead from the \u000d\u000avarious conversations was how much people are \u000d\u000ayearning for the connection of the visit, and how \u000d\u000agood it feels to feed and give care and kindness to \u000d\u000apeople.\u000d\u000a\u00d2mar shared how she felt \u201cthe Gaels really \u000d\u000aunderstand our interconnectedness as humans, as \u000d\u000apeople, and the visit remembers [and] practices \u000d\u000athat interconnection.\u201d She remembered how her \u000d\u000agreat-grandmother, M\u00f2r ni\u2019n Mhurchaidh \u000d\u000aDh\u00f2mhnaill | Sadie Mae MacInnis, taught her the \u000d\u000aetiquette of hosting, including how you must offer \u000d\u000aa guest tea at least three times before accepting a \u000d\u000arefusal. By the third time, they have usually gotten \u000d\u000aover their shyness and said yes! Sadie \u000d\u000ademonstrated the gift that is simply offering one\u2019s \u000d\u000atime and presence to be with another. She would \u000d\u000adrop everything if someone came to visit, giving \u000d\u000athem her focused and generous attention \u000d\u000aalongside the obligatory tea and snack. Indeed, the \u000d\u000alatter was really just a tangible symbol for the \u000d\u000aformer\u2014as \u00d2mar said, when she offered tea \u201cshe \u000d\u000awas offering me her love.\u201d\u000d\u000aWhen \u00d2mar took her own daughter to visit in the \u000d\u000acommunity, older women would often give little \u000d\u000aSadie a brooch or necklace. You rarely left a Gaelic \u000d\u000aperson\u2019s house without a little something to take \u000d\u000awith you. As \u00d2mar said, \u201cthat radical generosity is \u000d\u000apart of radical hospitality as well. There\u2019s \u000d\u000asomething very old and wise about this. There\u2019s \u000d\u000asome kind of magic and healing that happens \u000d\u000awhen we are radically kind to each other.\u201d\u000d\u000aIn Season 2, Session 6, Nova Scotia Gael, Carman \u000d\u000aNic Artair | Carmen MacArthur, spoke lovingly of \u000d\u000athe hospitality embodied by her neighbour and \u000d\u000amentor, the late M\u00e0iri ni\u2019n Ailig Bhig Alasdair \u00d2ig | \u000d\u000aMary MacKinnon. \u201cShe got as much joy out of \u000d\u000awatching you eating her baking as you did eating \u000d\u000ait,\u201d said Carmen. \u201cShe had a freezer in her \u000d\u000abasement that was just for baking. She had tons of \u000d\u000acompany just from the community, and Gaelic \u000d\u000a5","learners. She sent every single person home with \u000d\u000aa bag of her baking.\u201d\u000d\u000aTo Carmen, Mary represents an open-hearted \u000d\u000agenerosity and acceptance that she considers \u000d\u000aparticularly G\u00e0idhealach | Gaelic: \u201cI really look to \u000d\u000aM\u00e0iri as a role model. Just how many people she \u000d\u000awelcomed and how she just gave people that \u000d\u000afeeling of acceptance and that feeling of home. I \u000d\u000ahope that people, especially young people, who \u000d\u000awant to learn Gaelic will come and find me [and]\u000d\u000athey\u2019ll feel that sense of home coming into my \u000d\u000akitchen as I did in hers. If I can give people any \u000d\u000alittle inkling of what that was like then my job is \u000d\u000adone.\u201d Mary passed away in February 2021, and it \u000d\u000atook a year for friends and family to finish eating \u000d\u000aall the baked goods she\u2019d left in her freezer. We \u000d\u000afeel her generous spirit among us still.\u000d\u000aA' leigeil anail | Spaces to breathe\u000d\u000aBoth \u00d2mar and Te\u00e0rlach work hard to create \u000d\u000aGaelic gathering spaces which feel safe and \u000d\u000awelcoming for everyone, including \u201cminorities \u000d\u000awithin the minority,\u201d such as LGBTQIA+ and \u000d\u000aneurodivergent individuals. Despite the inherent \u000d\u000avalue of hospitality at the heart of Gaelic culture, \u000d\u000awe heard how many people do not feel \u000d\u000aautomatically welcomed into traditional cultural \u000d\u000aspaces. Te\u00e0rlach lives and works on the Hebridean \u000d\u000aisland of Lewis on the west coast of Scotland. It has \u000d\u000abeen his experience that every Pride event in his \u000d\u000atown is accompanied by a counter-protest of \u000d\u000aardent Free Presbyterians \u201ctelling us that we\u2019re \u000d\u000awrong and we\u2019re sinful.\u201d He expressed that he had \u000d\u000ano desire to tell people that \u201ctheir religion is \u000d\u000awrong,\u201d as he would consider that just another \u000d\u000aform of colonialism. But he did acknowledge how \u000d\u000ahe finds it \u201cincredibly difficult to find that loving \u000d\u000acommunity\u201d within this particular religious \u000d\u000aframework. His testament acknowledges the \u000d\u000atension between seeking safety and visibility for \u000d\u000aqueer Gaels, while also respecting the faiths that \u000d\u000ahave shaped Gaelic communities and in which \u000d\u000amany have found strength and meaning. \u000d\u000aThe change must come from within and in its own \u000d\u000atime, but, in the meantime, Te\u00e0rlach puts great \u000d\u000acare into trying to create \u201ca forcefield of \u000d\u000aprotection\u201d around those who might feel \u000d\u000aotherwise ostracized by certain aspects of wider \u000d\u000aGaelic culture. This has been a key value of An \u000d\u000aTaigh C\u00e9ilidh, the Gaelic Caf\u00e9 and community \u000d\u000aspace he runs in Stornoway. The volunteers there \u000d\u000aendeavour to make it as welcoming and inclusive \u000d\u000aas possible and the effect of knowing a space like \u000d\u000athis exists, even from afar, was felt by at least one \u000d\u000aperson on the Air Ch\u00e9ilidh call. They commented \u000d\u000ahow \u201cas a queer autistic person, when welcomes \u000d\u000aare given to a group, I always assume that I'm \u000d\u000aexcluded,\u201d but that it was \u201creally encouraging to \u000d\u000aattend this session\u201d and hear about initiatives such \u000d\u000aas An Taigh C\u00e9ilidh.\u000d\u000aCha t\u00e9id n\u00ec sam bith san d\u00f2rn d\u00f9inte\u000d\u000aNothing can go into a closed fist\u000d\u000a\u00d2mar acknowledged how \u201cit\u2019s really tricky, \u000d\u000acoming from a colonized culture, to lose so much \u000d\u000aso fast. I think it\u2019s easy for people to feel like they \u000d\u000awant to hang on to what there is and really sort of \u000d\u000aguard that.\u201d But she also suggested how we might \u000d\u000acollectively re-author that narrative of defense, \u000d\u000aguardedness and clinging tight to things out of \u000d\u000afear: \u201cOne of the things that I ask, and I wonder \u000d\u000aabout, about things that are traditionally \u000d\u000a\u2018G\u00e0idhealach\u2019 . . . when did they come in, how were \u000d\u000athey born? Are they things that are very old and \u000d\u000athings that the elders knew contributed to the \u000d\u000ahealth and wellbeing of the entire community, of \u000d\u000athe whole? Or are they things that were built out \u000d\u000aof a time of panic and trauma and lack and pain? . . \u000d\u000a. We don\u2019t need to be victim to that\u2014we can learn \u000d\u000amore expansive ways.\u201d\u000d\u000a6","This resonated with listeners in the conversation, \u000d\u000awith one person commenting how \u201cthese \u000d\u000aconversations have left me considering how I can \u000d\u000ainvite more hospitality into the way I live my life, \u000d\u000ahow can I embody it on a deeper level\u201d and \u000d\u000aanother saying that it was \u201cexciting to see \u000d\u000adiscussions around a hospitality that truly is \u000d\u000awelcoming to all.\u201d\u000d\u000aM\u00e0iri ni\u2019n Ailig Bhig Alasdair \u00d2ig | Mary (MacDonald) MacKinnon\u000d\u000aThe language of welcome\u000d\u000aAnother question which was touched on several \u000d\u000atimes throughout the seasons of Air Ch\u00e9ilidh was \u000d\u000ahow to embody the Gaelic value of welcome and \u000d\u000ahospitality while also retaining a commitment to \u000d\u000aspeaking Gaelic in gatherings of mixed language \u000d\u000aability. For various reasons, many Gaelic speakers \u000d\u000aseem to have internalized a message that it is rude \u000d\u000ato speak their language if there\u2019s even one person \u000d\u000apresent who doesn\u2019t understand it. How did this \u000d\u000anarrative take hold? Perhaps it stems from the \u000d\u000aGaelic value of wanting people to feel included and \u000d\u000aable to converse:\u000d\u000aCha\u2019n fhiach cuirm gun a c\u00f2mhradh\u000d\u000aA feast is worth nothing without its conversation\u000d\u000aBut it was felt by many to also be a direct result of \u000d\u000acolonization, as Gaelic was forced into \u000d\u000asubordination to English. In Season 3, Session 3, \u000d\u000ahost Iain MacLeod and guests Robert Pringle and \u000d\u000aDonelda McComb considered the nuances of \u000d\u000adifferent linguistic spaces and what it means to \u000d\u000aexist in a minority language community within a \u000d\u000awider geographic and cultural community. We \u000d\u000amust navigate different roles and contexts which \u000d\u000amay not always feel the most natural or \u000d\u000acomfortable, but there is much to be gained \u000d\u000athrough developing the courage to reclaim lost \u000d\u000aaspects of one\u2019s identity. \u201cIt feels unnatural at \u000d\u000atimes,\u201d Robert acknowledged, \u201cbut as a learner in \u000d\u000aNova Scotia you have to don this [Gaelic mantle]. \u000d\u000aYou have to put it on. It was taken away from us, it \u000d\u000awas unnaturally removed.\u201d One participant \u000d\u000acommented that \u201cthis is a story of multiple \u000d\u000agenerations not feeling safe as a minority and\u000d\u000alearning that they had to be \u2018polite\u2019 to not be \u000d\u000atargeted, and hopefully the culture has changed \u000d\u000aenough that this will no longer be the reality.\u201d\u000d\u000aRe-authoring the narrative that \u201cit\u2019s rude to speak \u000d\u000aa language around people who don\u2019t understand\u201d\u000d\u000amight look like making sure to welcome everyone \u000d\u000ato a space in the language they understand (a \u000d\u000apractice used by the organizers of Nova Scotia \u000d\u000aGaels\u2019 Jam events) but then finding ways to \u000d\u000aencourage and support learners in a Gaelic-only \u000d\u000aenvironment. Te\u00e0rlach spoke of subtly ensuring \u000d\u000athat Gaelic becomes \u201cthe unmarked code of the \u000d\u000aspace\u201d at the Taigh C\u00e9ilidh Caf\u00e9, using props to \u000d\u000ahelp people order their drinks in Gaelic and \u000d\u000aoffering a 10% discount as a fun encouragement \u000d\u000afor doing so. He noticed that through doing this, \u000d\u000athe distinctions between learners and native \u000d\u000aspeakers begin to blur: \u201cyou just have people who \u000d\u000aneed to communicate in this unmarked code.\u201d \u000d\u000aGaelic is suddenly not the minority anymore, \u000d\u000awhich is immensely validating for Gaels who are \u000d\u000aotherwise surrounded by constant reminders of \u000d\u000ahow their language is sidelined in mainstream life.\u000d\u000aRobert also spoke of how he tries to weave Gaelic \u000d\u000athrough his everyday interactions: \u201cI drop \u000d\u000asentences at the store. I say little greetings to \u000d\u000apeople who may not speak Gaelic. I do it with \u000d\u000aaffection and with joy.\u201d Donelda acknowledged \u000d\u000athat oftentimes people will switch from Gaelic to \u000d\u000aEnglish to accommodate an English-speaker \u000d\u000awithout confirming that hearing only Gaelic \u000d\u000abothers them: \u201cwe don't know how the person felt, \u000d\u000abecause we very readily went into English. Maybe \u000d\u000awe should have had a wee step back from that.\u201d\u000d\u000a7","Gabh air do shocair | Finding ease\u000d\u000aIn Season 2, Session 6, Lili Watson described how \u000d\u000aher mentor, M\u00eccheal E\u00f2in Chaluim Sheumais \u000d\u000aMh\u00f3ir | Migi John H. MacNeil communicated his \u000d\u000adesire to help her with her Gaelic, and also make \u000d\u000asure she was understanding, with a warmth and \u000d\u000alack of judgement that made her feel completely at \u000d\u000aease: \u201cWe mainly keep in Gaelic but like with any \u000d\u000anative Gaelic speaker they always want to make \u000d\u000asure that you\u2019re understanding them and that \u000d\u000ayou\u2019re comfortable. So sometimes we\u2019ll switch to \u000d\u000aEnglish, if he\u2019s feeling that I\u2019m not following, but \u000d\u000aI\u2019m pretty persistent in keeping in Gaelic with him. \u000d\u000aBecause I feel very comfortable speaking to Migi in \u000d\u000aGaelic, I feel like there\u2019s no judgement there which \u000d\u000amakes visiting with him that much more \u000d\u000aenjoyable.\u201d Migi passed away in 2024 and is \u000d\u000amissed by so many in the Gaelic community and \u000d\u000abeyond. \u000d\u000aIn some cases, music, rather than spoken language, \u000d\u000abecomes the primary medium for helping people \u000d\u000afeel at ease. In Season 1, Session 2, Marilyn \u201cMar\u201d\u000d\u000aMacDonald MacKinnon spoke to host, Bernadette \u000d\u000aCampbell, about her mother, Anna Dougall. A shy, \u000d\u000aquiet woman, Anna wasn\u2019t much of a talker, but \u000d\u000ashe loved to fill her home with people and offer \u000d\u000ahospitality through music. \u201cMummy was shy, she \u000d\u000awas really shy, and I think that [music] was a way \u000d\u000afor her to communicate.\u201d She would encourage her \u000d\u000alarge brood of children to perform, and she would \u000d\u000aalso play fiddle herself with visitors and swap \u000d\u000atunes with them. There was always tea from \u000d\u000aproper cups and saucers and fresh biscuits. Bread \u000d\u000awould be rising on top of the piano while she \u000d\u000aplayed tunes. \u201cMy mother was really good to take \u000d\u000apeople in,\u201d Mar remembered, \u201cespecially if they \u000d\u000awanted to experience the culture and the music, \u000d\u000ashe didn\u2019t care where they were from!\u201d\u000d\u000aWhether through the medium of Gaelic or English \u000d\u000aor music, many guests and participants \u000d\u000athroughout the seasons of Air Ch\u00e9ilidh spoke of the \u000d\u000atransformative power of a kind welcome. We \u000d\u000aspoke of how offering welcome and hospitality, to \u000d\u000aothers and to ourselves, helps to both soften and \u000d\u000astrengthen us. \u00d2mar noted how \u201cit's easy for us \u000d\u000awho are trying to reclaim our minority language to \u000d\u000abe hard on ourselves about it and to feel like we\u2019re \u000d\u000anot really doing good enough and our Gaelic\u2019s not \u000d\u000areally good enough. So that hospitality can extend \u000d\u000ainward as well.

What do we do when \u000d\u000aour edges become frayed, and we feel we are out \u000d\u000aof sync with our natural rhythms? Questions \u000d\u000aaround how we understand and navigate time \u000d\u000asurfaced in various conversations throughout the \u000d\u000aseasons of Air Ch\u00e9ilidh. We wondered how Gaelic \u000d\u000aand Indigenous wisdom might help us find more \u000d\u000asustainable, supportive rhythms in our daily lives. \u000d\u000aAir Ch\u00e9ilidh sessions prompted us to think about \u000d\u000adifferent ways of viewing the passage of our \u000d\u000alives\u2014as non-linear, as connected to generations \u000d\u000apast and present\u2014and how the \u201ctiming\u201d inherent \u000d\u000awithin music and dance traditions can give us a \u000d\u000asense of presence and connection that is deeply \u000d\u000anourishing.\u000d\u000aEach session of Air Ch\u00e9ilidh began with a lengthy \u000d\u000awelcome to help everyone arrive and feel \u000d\u000agrounded before moving into the first round of \u000d\u000abreakout rooms. Within those smaller group \u000d\u000aconversations, each participant was encouraged to \u000d\u000aspeak for as much of their allotted time as they felt \u000d\u000aable and be respectful of not talking through \u000d\u000asomeone else\u2019s time. Many of us are not used to \u000d\u000aconversations where both speech and silence are \u000d\u000aheld by the collective, and where we can allow a \u000d\u000athought to percolate slowly without worrying that \u000d\u000awe will be interrupted. Equally, our horror of the \u000d\u000a\u201cawkward silence\u201d is such that we have trained \u000d\u000aourselves to be constantly thinking about what we \u000d\u000amight say next, compromising our ability to listen \u000d\u000adeeply in the moment. Different and fumbly as it \u000d\u000amay have been at times, participants consistently \u000d\u000acommented on how much they appreciated the \u000d\u000aopportunity to connect and share with others in \u000d\u000athis more mindful way.\u000d\u000aThere is time\u000d\u000aThe pressure to rush\u2014through conversations, \u000d\u000athrough difficult tasks, through days, through \u000d\u000alife\u2014was a theme which seemed to resonate with \u000d\u000amany throughout the seasons of Air Ch\u00e9ilidh. \u000d\u000aParticipants acknowledged the changes that have \u000d\u000aoccurred even in the past few decades, and \u000d\u000alamented how fast-paced our lives have become. \u000d\u000aThis was a story that could be re-authored by \u000d\u000areorienting ourselves to the wisdom of older \u000d\u000agenerations.\u000d\u000aIn Season 2, Session 3, guest Rodney MacDonald \u000d\u000aspoke to host Mike Kennedy about his upbringing \u000d\u000ain Mabou, rural Cape Breton, and how he felt the \u000d\u000agenerations who raised him had a different kind of \u000d\u000aattitude towards, and respect for, time. He \u000d\u000aexplained that his father isn\u2019t a Gaelic-speaker \u000d\u000a\u201cbut he worked hard, and he had a very Gaelic way \u000d\u000aof living about him. He liked to do everything by \u000d\u000ahand.\u201d He remembered a time when he was \u000d\u000ahelping his father dig a hole and wondering why \u000d\u000athey weren\u2019t using a machine like their \u000d\u000aneighbours. \u201cWe have the time,\u201d his father said,\u000d\u000a\u201cwe have enough, we\u2019re not in a panic.\u201d Looking \u000d\u000aback, Rodney appreciated how the physical, \u000d\u000ademanding work also gave them precious time \u000d\u000atogether, working side-by-side as father and son, \u000d\u000awhich the machine would have taken away.\u000d\u000aSpending time in multi-generational spaces can \u000d\u000aprovide a very tangible sense of time through the \u000d\u000amemories and experiences of each age group. In \u000d\u000aSeason 1, Session 5, Colin Watson talked of what \u000d\u000ahe had learned about time from Migi John H. \u000d\u000aMacNeil, who was mentor to him as well as Colin\u2019s\u000d\u000asister, Lili. He explained how Migi kept a detailed \u000d\u000amental log of events that happened from the 1930s \u000d\u000aonwards, within his own lifetime, and how he \u000d\u000a\u201ckeeps time\u201d with the generations who were \u000d\u000aaround before he was born. \u201cHe has a great way of \u000d\u000akeeping track of history that way,\u201d Colin said. \u000d\u000aIn Season 2, Session 3, Angus Brendan MacNeil \u000d\u000afrom Barra talked of how he often thinks of his \u000d\u000aown family going back six generations and \u000d\u000awonders, were they all gathered in one room, who \u000d\u000awould get on, what could they learn from one \u000d\u000aanother and what would be the older generations\u2019\u000d\u000aopinion on the present day. He mentioned the last \u000d\u000amonolingual Gaelic-speaker on the island of Barra, \u000d\u000awho died around 1968. When someone asked her \u000d\u000a9","in her final years to speak about her life, she is \u000d\u000aremembered to have said, \u201cB\u2019fhe\u00e0rr leam fuireach \u000d\u000a\u2019s dh\u00e8anainn air fad a-rithist\u2019 e!\u201d | I would like to \u000d\u000astay and do it all again!\u000d\u000aBeing in time\u000d\u000aMusic offers us yet more ways to consider time, as \u000d\u000afiddler Rodney MacDonald touched on in the same \u000d\u000asession. He talked of the distinctive timing \u000d\u000ainherent in Nova Scotian Gaelic music and how he \u000d\u000afirst developed a felt sense of this as a child \u000d\u000astanding on his mother\u2019s feet as she danced to \u000d\u000afiddle tunes in the kitchen. This thread of \u000d\u000aintergenerational transmission continued with his \u000d\u000aown children. Watching his mother take her \u000d\u000agrandchildren onto her feet again to teach them to \u000d\u000adance gave Rodney a feeling of deep contentment.\u000d\u000aIn addition to a sense that life was generally \u000d\u000aslower in previous decades or centuries, many \u000d\u000apeople talk of the feeling that time speeds up \u000d\u000awithin our own lives as we get older, regardless of \u000d\u000ahow busy we are. Another year has passed in what \u000d\u000afeels like the blink of an eye. In music, however, \u000d\u000aregardless of language, time is allowed to exist \u000d\u000awithin a perpetual present comprised of rhythm \u000d\u000aand pulse. \u000d\u000aExperiencing the lift and flow of Gaelic music takes \u000d\u000aus \u201cout of time,\u201d as in the many stories of people \u000d\u000awho go into the s\u00ecthean | fairy hill and emerge \u000d\u000ayears later thinking they have only been there a \u000d\u000afew minutes. Whether it is through music, timebending fairy dwellings, work with our hands or \u000d\u000athe simple absorption of a good visit, the Gaelic \u000d\u000aworldview offers us opportunities to rethink our \u000d\u000arelationship to time and resist the modern \u000d\u000apressure to rush the rich experience of our lives.\u000d\u000aThe gift of presence\u000d\u000aMany of us feel we don\u2019t \u201chave time\u201d for many of \u000d\u000athe things we consider important in our lives, like \u000d\u000avisiting. \u201cHow do we make the time?\u201d \u00d2mar \u000d\u000aBuchanan asked in Season 3, Session 6, \u201cI think \u000d\u000awith great intentionality, really.\u201d In response, \u000d\u000amany listeners commented how they were \u000d\u000aresolving to slow down and to visit more. One \u000d\u000aparticipant said \u201cthe theme of going slower really \u000d\u000aresonated with us. My mom moved home to Cape \u000d\u000aBreton seven years ago and I moved my family \u000d\u000aback seven months ago, both of us with the intent \u000d\u000aof reconnecting with our communities and culture. \u000d\u000aNever considered that the \u2018slowing down\u2019 would \u000d\u000abe a part of that too!\u201d\u000d\u000aMar a\u2019s gainn\u2019 am biadh, \u2019s ann a\u2019s fial\u2019 a roinn\u000d\u000aThe scarcer the food, \u000d\u000athe more generous to share it\u000d\u000aThis proverb is perhaps as equally applicable to \u000d\u000atime as to food\u2014giving someone your undivided \u000d\u000aattention when they come to visit is the modern \u000d\u000aequivalent of laying out the finest baking, a mark \u000d\u000aof the same care and dedication in a world hellbent on distracting us at every turn. Gathering \u000d\u000atogether for Air Ch\u00e9ilidh gave many of us a \u000d\u000areassuring reminder that there is enough time for \u000d\u000athe things that matter. We can put our feet in the \u000d\u000agrass. We can sit with family. We can visit with \u000d\u000afriends. As one participant summed it up, \u201cI am \u000d\u000acommitted to remembering there is abundance \u000d\u000aavailable and it's no cost to make a big welcome.\u201d\u000d\u000a10","4. T\u00ecr | Land\u000d\u000aAt the beginning of every Air Ch\u00e9ilidh call, visitors\u000d\u000awere asked to write in the chat where they were \u000d\u000acalling from. It was a way of mapping communities \u000d\u000aacross the globe and connecting everyone from \u000d\u000athe first moment. One of the very special aspects \u000d\u000aof these online gatherings was that they brought \u000d\u000atogether people from all over the world with an \u000d\u000ainterest in, or connection to, Gaelic. Our team was \u000d\u000abased in Nova Scotia, but the gathering included \u000d\u000afolks from across Canada and the United States, \u000d\u000aScotland, and several other countries including \u000d\u000aBrazil. Concepts of land, home, lineage and \u000d\u000abelonging meant different things for different \u000d\u000apeople. But since all our hosts, and most of our \u000d\u000aguests and participants, were from either Nova \u000d\u000aScotia or Scotland, much of the conversations \u000d\u000acentred around the dynamics of land, indigeneity, \u000d\u000acolonization and right-relations within those two \u000d\u000aplaces.\u000d\u000aWhere we stand\u000d\u000aEach session of Air Ch\u00e9ilidh started with a Land \u000d\u000aAcknowledgment, recognising Nova Scotia\u2019s place \u000d\u000awithin Mi\u2019kma\u2019ki, the sacred ancestral and \u000d\u000aunceded land of the Mi\u2019kmaq First Nation. We \u000d\u000anamed the Mi\u2019kmaq as the past, present and future \u000d\u000acaretakers of the land. In Gaelic, we used the \u000d\u000aphrase \u201cbha c\u00e0irdeas agus co-roinneadh eadarainn \u000d\u000ao shean | there has been friendship and sharing\u000d\u000abetween us for a long time.\u201d This was intended not\u000d\u000aas a sugar-coating of past and present injustices,\u000d\u000abut to honour the generosity shown particularly\u000d\u000aby the Mi\u2019kmaq towards the Gaels when many\u000d\u000aarrived displaced and destitute from Scotland\u000d\u000aaround 200 years ago. It is undeniable that many\u000d\u000aGaels would not have survived their first year(s) in\u000d\u000aNova Scotia without the help of the Mi'kmaq and\u000d\u000atheir deep knowledge of the landscape.\u000d\u000aBeing a Gael in Nova Scotia is to hold together an \u000d\u000aIndigenous cultural lineage connecting back to the \u000d\u000aland in Scotland, and a settler identity within \u000d\u000aCanada. It is to belong to a people both colonized \u000d\u000aand colonizing, with all the nuance and complexity \u000d\u000aof each individual\u2019s experience of that history. It is \u000d\u000ato be governed by the Treaties of Peace and \u000d\u000aFriendship, signed by representatives of the \u000d\u000aBritish/Canadian Governments and the Mi\u2019kmaq.\u000d\u000aIs Luchd-c\u00f9mhnaint sinn uile\u000d\u000aWe are all Treaty People\u000d\u000aFrom Season 2 onwards, each season of Air \u000d\u000aCh\u00e9ilidh included a session dedicated to listening \u000d\u000ato and building relationships with our Mi\u2019kmaw \u000d\u000aneighbours. In one of these sessions (Season 2, \u000d\u000aSession 7) Mi\u2019kmaw guest, Sa\u2019n Sulian | John \u000d\u000aWilliam \u201cTiny\u201d Cremo, spoke of the urgent issue of \u000d\u000ahousing shortages within Mi\u2019kmaw communities \u000d\u000ain Nova Scotia and how a key reason for this is that \u000d\u000afollowing decades of settlement by colonizers, \u000d\u000athey simply do not have enough land to build on. \u000d\u000aHost Frances MacEachen articulated the irony of \u000d\u000aus joining so many others in starting our events \u000d\u000awith a land acknowledgment, when the Mi\u2019kmaq\u000d\u000ahave so little land.\u000d\u000aKnowing the land\u000d\u000aThere is much to consider within the stories of \u000d\u000acolonialism, past and present, in Scotland and in \u000d\u000aNova Scotia. Alongside the Mi\u2019kmaw experience, \u000d\u000aparticipants also considered the Gaels as \u000d\u000aIndigenous people to Scotland, displaced and \u000d\u000aoppressed through a series of injustices including \u000d\u000athe Highland Clearances. Participants pondered \u000d\u000athe teachings held in Gaelic culture that can help \u000d\u000aus to live in right-relationship with the land and \u000d\u000aeach other. We talked about how our ancestors, \u000d\u000awherever they were from, connected to their \u000d\u000ahome places and all the life forms there, and how \u000d\u000awe might do the same today.\u000d\u000aThrough the seasons of Air Ch\u00e9ilidh, participants\u000d\u000abegan a process of coming to know the land \u000d\u000athrough Indigenous Gaelic and Mi\u2019kmaw \u000d\u000aperspectives. In Season 4, Session 3, I (M\u00e0iri) \u000d\u000ahosted a session and invited my friend Ceit | Kate\u000d\u000aLanghorne to be my guest. Ceit is a Gaelic speaker, \u000d\u000aartist and PhD candidate researching Gaelic storytelling and ecology. She led us on a roaming \u000d\u000a11","journey through the landscapes of an t-Seann \u000d\u000aD\u00f9thaich | the Old Country, our native Scotland. \u000d\u000aThrough Gaelic names, stories and reflections, we \u000d\u000aconsidered what it means to see the world through \u000d\u000a\u201cGaelic eyes\u201d and the ways in which this \u000d\u000aunderstanding of the land can nourish us.\u000d\u000aCeit gave examples of how Gaelic place names can \u000d\u000aspeak to so many features in the landscape, as well \u000d\u000aas acting as remembrances for people and animals \u000d\u000awho live(d) there. Often, they speak to the \u000d\u000adisplacement of a people\u2014the Gaels\u2014and the loss \u000d\u000aof biodiversity in Scotland. \u201cYou can\u2019t ignore the \u000d\u000afact that the people that these place names \u000d\u000adescribe . . . they\u2019re no longer there,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd \u000d\u000ayou also can\u2019t ignore the absence of the \u000d\u000abiodiversity that these place names also talk about \u000d\u000ain the Scottish landscape.\u201d\u000d\u000aFor example, the word madadh, found in many \u000d\u000aplace names, commonly means \u201cfox\u201d today, but it \u000d\u000amost likely referred to wolves in the past. Wolves \u000d\u000awere completely wiped out by hunting by the end \u000d\u000aof the 18th century but are now being \u000d\u000areintroduced within controlled conservation \u000d\u000aareas in the Scottish Highlands. Foraging places, \u000d\u000afishing spots and summer pastures, or \u00e0irighean, \u000d\u000aare all remembered through place names. Ceit told \u000d\u000aus that any name with \u2018-ruigh\u2019 in it probably refers \u000d\u000ato \u00e0irigh, a shieling. There are at least 110 words \u000d\u000afor hill or mountain, some of which offer warnings \u000d\u000aof potentially treacherous topography. The land is \u000d\u000aalso embodied with words like lurgann | shank or \u000d\u000ahaunch, druim | back or s\u00f9il | eye to describe its \u000d\u000afeatures. In the Gaelic worldview, the land is alive \u000d\u000ain more ways than one, a perception which is \u000d\u000aparalleled in Mi\u2019kmaw belief as well.\u000d\u000aBehind Ceit\u2019s own home in Baile a\u2019 Chaolais | \u000d\u000aBallachulish is Beinn Bheithir, thought to be the \u000d\u000ahome of Cailleach a\u2019 Bheithir | The Old Woman of \u000d\u000aBeithir. A remarkable wooden carving of a female \u000d\u000adeity was found preserved in a peatbog in the area, \u000d\u000adating to 600BC. Ceit talked of the symbolism of \u000d\u000athe Cailleach, the hag of winter, and how she meets \u000d\u000athe goddess Br\u00ecghde at the end of winter to \u000d\u000adiscuss, perhaps to argue, before Br\u00ecghde \u000d\u000aeventually takes over and ushers the land into \u000d\u000aspring. Some versions of the Cailleach see her as \u000d\u000aprotector of wild places and the deer herds that \u000d\u000aroam the Highlands.\u000d\u000aArtwork \u00a9 Claire Hewitt\u000d\u000aMapping Gaelic names and stories onto the \u000d\u000alandscape has formed much of the work Ceit does \u000d\u000aas a Gaelic consultant to environmental and \u000d\u000aeducational organizations such as Trees for Life\u000d\u000aand the Shieling Project. At the Dundreggan Rewilding Centre in Glenmoriston near Loch Ness, \u000d\u000ashe helps people see the land through the eyes of \u000d\u000aits natural inhabitants\u2014the plants, animals and \u000d\u000aalso the local people who, at the start of the 20th \u000d\u000acentury, were entirely Gaelic-speaking. In this \u000d\u000away, she is using the folklore of the Gaels to help \u000d\u000apeople strengthen their understanding of, and \u000d\u000aconnection to, the land, and to further the \u000d\u000aimportant environmental conservation efforts \u000d\u000agoing on within various communities.\u000d\u000aVisiting with the Land\u000d\u000aBack in Nova Scotia, in Season 4, Session 5, \u000d\u000aMi\u2019kmaw activist Tara Lewis spoke of her regular \u000d\u000apractice of visiting family and friends, including \u000d\u000aher non-human relations. She often feels called to \u000d\u000avisit a certain place: \u201cI never know what the \u000d\u000apurpose for me is to go there, but once I\u2019m there it \u000d\u000acomes together why I need to be there. Being a \u000d\u000aMi\u2019kmaw woman, having that connection to the \u000d\u000aland, I think sometimes too that land also calls me, \u000d\u000aeven if I\u2019m aware or not, and then when I\u2019m there \u000d\u000ain that territory it becomes apparent why I\u2019m \u000d\u000athere.\u201d\u000d\u000a12","Tara spoke of how, as a child, she would visit \u000d\u000aplants and animals the same way she visited her \u000d\u000aneighbours. She still feels the importance of \u000d\u000avisiting Mother Earth. She hikes regularly yearround: \u201cthe longer I hike the more connected I feel, \u000d\u000athat I\u2019m with her.\u201d\u000d\u000aThis struck a chord with listeners on the call, with \u000d\u000aone participant commenting, \u201cI don\u2019t visit Mother \u000d\u000aNature enough. I\u2019m overdue for some quality time \u000d\u000awith her.\u201d Another observed how \u201cland and \u000d\u000alandscape are important to so many people. A \u000d\u000asource of comfort. You can understand the longing \u000d\u000athat some emigrants felt when they never were \u000d\u000aable to return to their landscapes.\u201d \u000d\u000aOf course, it was not just emigrants who felt this \u000d\u000acianalas | homesickness. From Tara and Bradley \u000d\u000aMurphy\u2019s other guest, Sarah Prosper, we learned a \u000d\u000alittle of the devastating impacts of Centralization, \u000d\u000awhen Mi\u2019kmaq were driven from their lands and \u000d\u000aonto reserves in Nova Scotia in the 1940s. The \u000d\u000alands they were forced to leave either remained \u000d\u000awith the Crown or were bought by settlers, the \u000d\u000arepercussions of which are being felt strongly \u000d\u000atoday, and are yet to be properly reconciled.\u000d\u000aThis theme was also explored in Season 3, Session \u000d\u000a2, when host Frances MacEachen spoke to three \u000d\u000aother Mi\u2019kmaw women\u2014Susan Copage and \u000d\u000asisters Ella and Eva Nicholas\u2014about their healing \u000d\u000aand reclamation work around land, language and \u000d\u000aculture. \"We have a lot of grief,\u201d Eva explained, \u000d\u000a\u201cWe've been so connected to the land, and now we \u000d\u000aare disconnected. We are in reserves, and we don't \u000d\u000ahave access to the land like our ancestors once \u000d\u000adid.\u201d Despite this, Eva has developed detailed \u000d\u000aknowledge of basket weaving and plant medicine, \u000d\u000alearning from a Mi\u2019kmaw Elder who learned from \u000d\u000aEva\u2019s own great-grandmother. Eva shared some of \u000d\u000athis knowledge on a plant walk as part of a special \u000d\u000ain-person gathering organised by The Gaelic \u000d\u000aNarrative Project and the We'koqma'q community\u000d\u000ain the summer of 2022.\u000d\u000aWhen Frances asked, in our online gathering, what \u000d\u000asettler people like the Gaels could do to support \u000d\u000athe Mi'kmaq in reclaiming their language and \u000d\u000atraditions, Eva\u2019s answer was gracious and \u000d\u000ameaningful. \u201cTake part in our events,\u201d she \u000d\u000asuggested. \u201cCome learn, ask questions, just come \u000d\u000alearn about our culture and history from our \u000d\u000anarrative, from our perspective, because what has \u000d\u000abeen taught has not been from our perspective \u000d\u000aand narrative.\u201d She also reflected on how opening\u000d\u000aup access to the land and waterways is important \u000d\u000aso the Mi\u2019kmaq can collect medicine. \u201cPerhaps \u000d\u000asomeone has an ash tree, birch tree, or even \u000d\u000aporcupines that could be used in crafts,\u201d she said, \u000d\u000aand expressed how it is nice to get an invitation to \u000d\u000avisit peoples\u2019 land. \u000d\u000aAnd so emerged a simple, tangible way to connect \u000d\u000aand support new stories: a\u2019 dol air ch\u00e9ilidh | going \u000d\u000ato visit each other on the land.

Coimhearsnachd | Community\u000d\u000aOne of the resounding themes to come out of the \u000d\u000aAir Ch\u00e9ilidh sessions was how much participants \u000d\u000aappreciated the opportunity to gather with others \u000d\u000ato foster and feel a sense of community. Even \u000d\u000awithin the online format, people expressed \u000d\u000agratitude for the connection it brought them, \u000d\u000aespecially during the isolating and challenging \u000d\u000amonths of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was also \u000d\u000aparticularly meaningful for those participants who \u000d\u000alived far from geographical Gaelic communities to \u000d\u000abe able to connect with others who shared their \u000d\u000alanguage, culture or interests. Many people \u000d\u000amentioned how the break-out rooms provided \u000d\u000aenriching conversations and new friends. \u201cI just \u000d\u000awas in my breakout session with a person in \u000d\u000aVancouver and another from California,\u201d one \u000d\u000aparticipant commented. \u201cOur conversation was all \u000d\u000ain Gaelic\u2014celebrate the small victories!\u201d\u000d\u000aThe fabric of our community\u000d\u000aThe Gaelic for community is coimhearsnachd, \u000d\u000awhich is closely related to coimhearsnach meaning \u000d\u000a\u2018neighbour.\u2019 Communities are built from layered \u000d\u000ainteractions between people whose needs and\u000d\u000ainterests interlace in the cur is dl\u00f9th | weft and \u000d\u000awarp of daily life.

Through her strength and \u000d\u000aresourcefulness, and the support of neighbours \u000d\u000awho organized frolics to cut her firewood and \u000d\u000abring in hay for her cows, she stayed afloat despite \u000d\u000aher struggles. She was a skilled weaver, making all \u000d\u000athe blankets, cloths and children\u2019s clothes she \u000d\u000aneeded for her household, whilst also weaving and \u000d\u000asewing tweed garments for others in the \u000d\u000acommunity. When she had woven enough cloth, \u000d\u000aneighbours would come for a milling frolic to help \u000d\u000afull and shrink the fibre. When out-migration to \u000d\u000athe Boston States ramped up, departing men and \u000d\u000awomen came to Peggy to get her to make them a \u000d\u000abeautiful suit or skirt for the journey. \u201cI am sure no \u000d\u000amatter how long they kept that suit, they would \u000d\u000aalways think of Peggy. So, the North Shore went \u000d\u000awith them,\u201d Nona said. These garments became \u000d\u000aliteral and metaphorical representations of the \u000d\u000aintricate threads binding the community together \u000d\u000aand connecting these far-flung Gaels back to their \u000d\u000ahome. \u000d\u000aPeggy\u2019s story, and those of other women discussed \u000d\u000ain the same session, moved and inspired many \u000d\u000alisteners that evening. \u201cThese women have tugged \u000d\u000aat my heartstrings and soul,\u201d one person \u000d\u000acommented. \u201cImages of Peggy's spinning frolics \u000d\u000aput wind in my sails for a more communal and \u000d\u000amutually supported future,\u201d another shared.\u000d\u000aCommunity building\u000d\u000aIn Season 3, Session 4, host Margie Beaton \u000d\u000adiscussed the theme of community with her guests \u000d\u000a15","\u00c0dhamh D\u00e0maireach | Adam Dahmer and K.C. \u000d\u000aBeaton. Both spoke of the importance of language \u000d\u000ain Gaelic community creation, with K.C. describing \u000d\u000ait as the warp onto which the complimenting \u000d\u000athreads of culture are woven. \u000d\u000a\u00c0dhamh, who hails from Kentucky, took us to a \u000d\u000amoment when he was a student staying in the \u000d\u000atraditional Gaelic community of Flodigarry in the \u000d\u000anorth of the Isle of Skye. Singing songs with other \u000d\u000aGaels there, learners and native speakers alike, \u000d\u000agave him a strong sense of community. \u201cAll of us \u000d\u000a[were] together in the hall of this hostel with \u000d\u000apeople from all over the world,\u201d he remembered. \u000d\u000a\u201cAnd I remember we joined in the chorus of \u2018M\u00f2rag \u000d\u000aof Dun Bheagan\u2019\u201d\u2014he sang the chorus \u2014\u201cfor some \u000d\u000aof us, that\u2019s all we could manage of the song, but by \u000d\u000aGod we had that part, and we were belting it! And \u000d\u000aI thought to myself, well this is just wonderful.\u201d \u000d\u000aLater, somewhat to his surprise, \u00c0dhamh\u000d\u000aexperienced the same feeling in his home state of \u000d\u000aKentucky when he led others in singing the same \u000d\u000asong in a pub. He felt a deep satisfaction that he \u000d\u000ahad managed to recreate something of that special \u000d\u000amoment in Flodigarry for his \u201chome crowd\u201d across \u000d\u000athe ocean. \u201cThat was a very satisfying moment. I \u000d\u000awant everybody to have a moment like that\u2014\u000d\u000awhere they find something they enjoy and are able\u000d\u000ato recreate it for other people.\u201d\u000d\u000aWhere Gaelic lives\u000d\u000aThe contexts in which Gaelic is naturally spoken \u000d\u000ahave changed significantly over the past century. \u000d\u000aFor many, their opportunities to speak the \u000d\u000alanguage are often concentrated around private \u000d\u000avisits, language classes or Gaelic cultural events \u000d\u000asuch as dances, concerts and milling frolics. But \u000d\u000awhat about other \u201cthird spaces,\u201d as they\u2019re \u000d\u000asometimes called, such as the library, the gym, the \u000d\u000asports field etc.? \u000d\u000aIn Season 1, Session 3, Host Iain MacLeod began by \u000d\u000atalking about his work as a storyteller and \u000d\u000afilmmaker, and his curiosity around the narratives \u000d\u000awe tell ourselves and each other. He explained \u000d\u000ahow his parents were persuaded into a colonial \u000d\u000anarrative that mandated people to speak English \u000d\u000aand warned that speaking Gaelic would at worst \u000d\u000ahold you back and at best simply be irrelevant to \u000d\u000aanyone living outside of the most traditional of \u000d\u000arural G\u00e0idhealtachd areas. From this, Iain had \u000d\u000ainternalized a perspective that unless he was \u000d\u000agoing to move to a croft in North Uist there was \u000d\u000anowhere the language could fit into his life. For the \u000d\u000afollowing hour he and visitors on the call set about \u000d\u000are-authoring this narrative and exploring the \u000d\u000adifferent spaces where Gaelic can live, thrive and \u000d\u000afoster connection.\u000d\u000aScottish football (soccer) players Donnie Forbes \u000d\u000aand Calum Fergusson spoke of their organization, \u000d\u000aFC Sonas, which offers Gaelic language instruction \u000d\u000aand encouragement alongside sports training. \u000d\u000a\u201cThe beauty of sports is that it adds a fun element, \u000d\u000awhere you don't realize you are using the \u000d\u000alanguage,\u201d said Calum. In Scotland, children often \u000d\u000aassociate the language with school, so social \u000d\u000aoutlets are important, so the language thrives in \u000d\u000acommunity. \u201cWe have an opportunity to use \u000d\u000afootball and Gaelic as a catalyst for social change \u000d\u000awithin the community,\u201d said Donnie.\u000d\u000aGr\u00e1inne N\u00ed Fhoighil of Connemara, Ireland, said it \u000d\u000awas natural for her to do her activities in Gaeilge | \u000d\u000aIrish Gaelic, but teaching mindfulness to children \u000d\u000awas a new subject, requiring new vocabulary. As \u000d\u000ashe travelled to different communities, she found \u000d\u000athat the children were not only eager to learn the \u000d\u000ayoga and mindfulness practices she was teaching, \u000d\u000abut that they were also excited to share their own \u000d\u000adialects\u2019 words for the feelings and sensations \u000d\u000aassociated with them. \u201cI found that really exciting,\u201d\u000d\u000ashe said. \u201cThere was a richness scattered around,\u000d\u000aand this was one way of collecting it together.\u201d\u000d\u000aMeanwhile, Seoige NicDh\u00f2mhnuill | Joyce \u000d\u000aMacDonald spoke of the motivation and \u000d\u000acamaraderie which had developed through the \u000d\u000aGaelic writers\u2019 group she set up. Being able to \u000d\u000acombine Gaelic with an existing or developing \u000d\u000apassion felt deeply nourishing and inspiring and\u000d\u000ahelped to course-correct the limiting belief that \u000d\u000aGaelic is only relevant in certain contexts. \u000d\u000aThe narrative which emerged from this session, \u000d\u000aand others, was that Gaelic can thrive in all kinds \u000d\u000aof geographical neighborhoods and communities \u000d\u000a16","of interest. Participants commented how they felt \u000d\u000ainspired to sing, write, bake, kayak, visit, play \u000d\u000asports, garden, lift weights, tell stories and \u000d\u000acommunicate more in Gaelic. Participants shared \u000d\u000adreams of what we would like to see for Gaelic, \u000d\u000awith one listener describing how \u201cI would love to \u000d\u000alive in a house or a small community where we all \u000d\u000aspeak Gaelic as our social language, I would like to \u000d\u000awork on a million more films and learn to sing tons \u000d\u000amore songs and have no fear in singing them \u000d\u000aloudly. Also, a Gaelic pop punk band!\u201d Dreaming \u000d\u000atogether in this way created a palpable energy \u000d\u000awhich we were able to carry forward into our daily \u000d\u000alives after the call. \u000d\u000aCommunity care\u000d\u000aGaelic can help us to live and thrive, and it can also \u000d\u000ahelp us navigate death and loss. At these times, we \u000d\u000aoften feel the gifts of community with particular \u000d\u000apoignancy. We lean on the comfort of familiar, \u000d\u000along-standing traditions, and appreciate the ones \u000d\u000awho show up to offer presence and support. \u000d\u000aIn Season 4, Session 6, Frances MacEachen and her \u000d\u000aguests considered the Gaelic customs which have \u000d\u000aevolved to carry us, or help us support others, \u000d\u000athrough the transition of dying. Frances said that \u000d\u000aher interest in this topic grew from remembrances \u000d\u000aof her own grandmother, M\u00e0iri Anna Iain \u000d\u000aShandaidh | Mary Anne Cameron. She had been \u000d\u000awell-known in her community as someone who \u000d\u000awas skilled in caring for the bodies of people who \u000d\u000ahad died. As Frances said, \u201cWhile some people \u000d\u000awere really gifted in helping people enter the \u000d\u000aworld, she was really gifted at helping them exit.\u201d\u000d\u000aThe title of the session\u2014An Leaba-shiubhail | The \u000d\u000atravelling bed\u2014came from M\u00e0iri Anna\u2019s name for \u000d\u000athe bed, often downstairs in the house in a room \u000d\u000aoff the kitchen, upon which many people both \u000d\u000aentered and left the world. This \u201ctravelling bed\u201d \u000d\u000aconnects to one of the Gaelic words for dying: a\u2019 \u000d\u000asiubhal, which literally means \u201ctravelling.\u201d You can \u000d\u000asay shiubhail i | \u201cshe died,\u201d or also the enigmatic \u000d\u000achaochail e | \u201che changed\u201d to say that someone has \u000d\u000apassed on.\u000d\u000aFrances remembers looking through an album of \u000d\u000aphotos her grandmother kept of loved ones lying \u000d\u000ain their caskets. The living people in the photos \u000d\u000aoften had their hands resting gently on the bodies \u000d\u000aof the dead, demonstrating both a tenderness and \u000d\u000aan ease that people had with death. This theme \u000d\u000arecurred throughout the evening\u2019s conversation \u000d\u000aas Frances and her guests reflected on how the \u000d\u000aclose bonds of family and community\u2014the \u000d\u000aintimacy of growing up and living around the same \u000d\u000apeople all of one\u2019s life, coupled with shared culture \u000d\u000aand customs\u2014helped to foster a sense of comfort \u000d\u000aaround all of life\u2019s stages, including death.\u000d\u000aM\u00e0iri Anna Iain Shandaidh | Mary Anne Cameron\u000d\u000aIn Gaelic culture, the taigh faire | wake house is a \u000d\u000aplace of both mourning and celebrations, a final \u000d\u000ac\u00e9ilidh for the dead. Faire means to watch, guard \u000d\u000aor keep vigil and is a way of making sure that\u000d\u000aneither the dead nor their family are alone in fear \u000d\u000aor with their grief. Frances\u2019 first guest, Jean \u000d\u000aMacNeil, spoke of the calm and practical care \u000d\u000ataken by community members\u2014washing and \u000d\u000apreparing the bodies of the dead, and building\u000d\u000atheir caskets\u2014before these responsibilities were \u000d\u000aoutsourced to funeral parlours. \u000d\u000aSeumas Y. D\u00f2mhnallach | Shamus Y. MacDonald \u000d\u000areflected on the good-natured pranking which \u000d\u000aoften went on at traditional wakes. \u201cThey weren\u2019t \u000d\u000anecessarily the sedate, solemn, religious affairs we \u000d\u000athink of them as today,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf the death \u000d\u000awas anticipated, if the person had lived a good long \u000d\u000a17","life and had a good death, the tone could be quite \u000d\u000acheerful. I\u2019ve talked to some people who said it\u000d\u000awas more like a wedding or a party\u2014there was \u000d\u000afood, there was drink, people were visiting and \u000d\u000acatching up.\u201d\u000d\u000aIn Season 1, Session 4, host Margie Beaton shared \u000d\u000aan example of this, recalling the joyful dancing and \u000d\u000amusic that happened spontaneously in the West \u000d\u000aMabou Hall following the dance\u2019s founder, Jimmy \u000d\u000aMacInnis\u2019, funeral.\u201cSo, all the musicians started to \u000d\u000agather, and the tunes went full speed as you would \u000d\u000aplay at a dance,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn't in a mournful \u000d\u000away, but a celebratory way. And then the dancing \u000d\u000astarted, and people got up to dance. And it was \u000d\u000aincredible to see people like Trevor, his nephew, \u000d\u000aand Peter, his son, getting up to dance and coming \u000d\u000aback on 'er on such a sorrowful day but in such a \u000d\u000abeautiful celebration.\u201d\u000d\u000aBack in Season 4, Session 6, Frances\u2019s third and \u000d\u000afinal guest, Cassandra Yonder, spoke from her \u000d\u000aextensive experience studying death in an \u000d\u000aacademic context and participating in community \u000d\u000adeathcare work. She acknowledged the discomfort \u000d\u000aand alienation many of us may feel now that death \u000d\u000ahas become a more sanitized and institutionalized \u000d\u000aprocess. Very few people are still waked at home \u000d\u000ain the traditional manner. We may struggle to \u000d\u000aknow what to say when someone loses a loved \u000d\u000aone, and struggle even more with our own feelings \u000d\u000aof grief around the loss of a beloved.\u000d\u000aCassandra reflected that our Gaelic customs and \u000d\u000atraditions, vivid within living memory, may offer \u000d\u000aus a way to reclaim death as a community and \u000d\u000acultural experience. She pointed out how \u201chealthy \u000d\u000agrieving is about reducing that alienation\u201d that \u000d\u000amany of us now feel. She spoke of maintaining \u000d\u000a\u201ccontinuing bonds\u201d with those who have passed, \u000d\u000aan idea which resonated with many at the \u000d\u000asession. \u201cI loved hearing about the continuing \u000d\u000abonds piece,\u201d one participant said. \u201cI feel it built \u000d\u000ainto Gaelic cultural expression so much\u2014as \u000d\u000acomposers, singers, storytellers, etc. are \u000d\u000aremembered long after they have passed as we \u000d\u000asing their songs, play their tunes, dance their \u000d\u000asteps, etc.\u201d\u000d\u000aAnother participant commented how \u201cthis \u000d\u000adialogue makes me realize that not everyone is as \u000d\u000aalienated from death as I was, and I want to learn \u000d\u000amore about the rich death-caring traditions that \u000d\u000ahelp us maintain continued bonds with our dead.\u201d \u000d\u000aGrief as a process takes time and its pain can be \u000d\u000asoothed by community support. Just as Gaels \u000d\u000ahave gathered together to form work parties for \u000d\u000aall kinds of tasks, from milling to barn raising to \u000d\u000aharvesting to spinning, we can continue this \u000d\u000apractice in our collective death work as well. \u000d\u000aAttending an taigh faire | the wake house is still a \u000d\u000acommon practice among the Gaelic communities \u000d\u000aof Nova Scotia\u2014what other practices might we \u000d\u000are-kindle to honour our ancestors and our living \u000d\u000aculture as it continues to grow today? \u000d\u000aGaelic-Mi\u2019kmaw gathering at Skye River Trail, We'koqma'q, 2022 [image credit: Margie Beaton]\u000d\u000a18","6. Cruthachas | Creativity\u000d\u000aFor many people in the Gaelic community, music \u000d\u000aand other creative arts live at the heart of their \u000d\u000acultural and community experience, acting as a \u000d\u000atouchstone for what it means to live and express \u000d\u000aoneself in a Gaelic way. Given music\u2019s crosscultural accessibility, it is often the thread which \u000d\u000ainitially pulls people into closer engagement with \u000d\u000athe culture. A song may captivate a new listener\u2019s \u000d\u000aear, or it may rekindle a precious memory of being \u000d\u000asung to as a child. Alongside music, Gaelic culture \u000d\u000ais also enriched by many other forms of creative \u000d\u000aexpression from praise poems to improvised step \u000d\u000adancing, tall tales to witty impersonations, cloth to \u000d\u000acarvings, and so much more. \u000d\u000aCreative arts wove their way through the series of \u000d\u000aAir Ch\u00e9ilidh, both in the topics discussed and the \u000d\u000amusic which bookended the sessions. Many\u000d\u000asessions began with an archival recording of Nova \u000d\u000aScotia Gaelic singers or fiddlers and ended with a \u000d\u000asharing from our many musical guests. \u000d\u000aParticipants were encouraged to set aside their \u000d\u000aself-censorship and draw us into vivid, immersive \u000d\u000astories. One of the great things about re-authoring \u000d\u000ais that, when the process is flowing, people \u000d\u000atransform into storytellers on the spot. \u000d\u000aCreating together\u000d\u000aDuring the discussions, participants explored \u000d\u000atopics such as the connection between fiddle \u000d\u000amusic and the Gaelic language, the \u000d\u000aintergenerational joy of square dancing, creative \u000d\u000awriting and filmmaking and the subtle art of Gaelic \u000d\u000ahumour. They thought about how these art forms \u000d\u000aare often created and shared within the collective: \u000d\u000aa song improvised around the milling table, a new \u000d\u000afiddle tune appreciated by the dancers in a square \u000d\u000aset, a community in-joke which contains four \u000d\u000agenerations\u2019 worth of history in a single quip. They \u000d\u000aconnect us to a time when Gaels were remarkably \u000d\u000aself-sufficient in both material culture and \u000d\u000aentertainment and give us insight into the \u000d\u000ainterplay between individual self-expression and \u000d\u000acommunity cohesion within the culture. \u000d\u000aThe gifts of music\u000d\u000aIn Season 3, Session 5, fiddlers Shelly Campbell \u000d\u000aand Glenn Graham spoke of their musical journeys, \u000d\u000aparticularly the support they received from their \u000d\u000afamilies and communities and how this influenced \u000d\u000atheir playing style. They spoke of their music both \u000d\u000aas a cultural inheritance and as a conduit for \u000d\u000aindividual self-expression. Gifts were mentioned \u000d\u000amany times, whether in the form of physical items, \u000d\u000aguidance and encouragement from adults or the \u000d\u000aidea of creative \u201ctalent\u201d received from the \u000d\u000aOtherworld. \u000d\u000aGlenn remembered his late grandfather, \u000d\u000arenowned fiddler Donald Angus Beaton, gifting \u000d\u000ahim a fiddle and bow when he was seven years old. \u000d\u000aHe interpreted the gift as a vote of confidence in \u000d\u000ahis potential and it had a profound effect on him.\u000d\u000a\u201cIt was a really formative moment,\u201d he recalled, \u201cI \u000d\u000acould see myself continuing.\u201d He also remembered \u000d\u000ahis mother Mary (n\u00e9e Beaton) guiding him in \u000d\u000alearning \u201cthe locally accepted norm of what\u2019s \u000d\u000acorrect for a tune.\u201d She explained that if you go \u000d\u000abeyond the locally accepted \u2018correct\u2019 form the \u000d\u000alisteners will notice, and she taught him that it was \u000d\u000aa sign of respect to play the local version \u000d\u000a\u201ccorrectly.\u201d\u000d\u000aMany Gaelic women who may not have played \u000d\u000ainstruments themselves nonetheless held detailed \u000d\u000aand extensive repertoires of tunes in their \u000d\u000amemory. They passed these on to younger \u000d\u000agenerations in the form of puirt-\u00e1-beul songs or by \u000d\u000a\u201cjigging\u201d (diddling) the tunes. Their role was \u000d\u000ainvaluable in ensuring the transmission of \u000d\u000amelodies, including, as Glenn mentioned, the \u000d\u000asubtleties of local variations.\u000d\u000aThig cr\u00ecoch air an t-saoghal \u000d\u000aach mairidh gaol is ce\u00f2l\u000d\u000aLife comes to an end but love and music live on\u000d\u000aWhilst there was not so much music in Shelly\u2019s \u000d\u000aimmediate family, she received gifts from the \u000d\u000awider community, from people who noticed her \u000d\u000a19","developing interest in music. \u201cThe greater \u000d\u000acommunity is always kind of looking out [to] see \u000d\u000athat interest sparking,\u201d she said. She received \u000d\u000amusic books, and a music stand, as well as \u000d\u000abenefiting from the \u201cfast-paced trading of tapes\u201d \u000d\u000awhich went on at the pulp mill where her father \u000d\u000aworked. \u000d\u000aShelly\u2019s bus driver was also none other than the \u000d\u000arenowned fiddler Theresa MacLellan, one of the \u000d\u000afew female fiddle players at the time. Shelly was \u000d\u000arather in awe of her and greatly admired Theresa\u2019s \u000d\u000astyle which went on to influence her own playing. \u000d\u000aTheresa would sometimes pull the bus over to play \u000d\u000aShelly\u2019s fiddle on days when she had it with her for \u000d\u000aa school event. This image touched several \u000d\u000aparticipants on the Air Ch\u00e9ilidh call, with one \u000d\u000acommenting: \u201cI love the idea of Theresa playing a \u000d\u000atune by the side of the road. The image of \u2018bho \u000d\u000aghl\u00f9in gu gl\u00f9in | from knee to knee\u2019 makes so much \u000d\u000asense.\u201d\u000d\u000aTheresa MacLellan & Shelly Campbell\u000d\u000aShelly told the story of how Theresa MacLellan\u2019s \u000d\u000afamily received the gift of music. Her father, \u201cBig \u000d\u000aRonald\u201d MacLellan, was a blacksmith who was so \u000d\u000astrong it was said he could twist a horseshoe \u000d\u000aaround with his bare hands. He was also a \u000d\u000arenowned fiddler and believed that his creative \u000d\u000aabilities came from a special fiddle bow which had \u000d\u000abeen fashioned from a fairy arrow found and \u000d\u000agifted to him by his aunt. This motif appears in \u000d\u000amany Gaelic stories and offers a way of thinking \u000d\u000aabout creativity which reflects the close presence \u000d\u000aof the Otherworld and the role of magical thinking \u000d\u000ain Gaelic consciousness. This contrasts with a \u000d\u000amore Anglocentric, post-Renaissance view of \u000d\u000ahuman \u2018genius\u2019 as being something innate within \u000d\u000aspecial individuals, best accessed through periods\u000d\u000aof anguished isolation. The Gaelic worldview \u000d\u000aoffers a way to reframe the narrative around \u000d\u000acreativity and inspiration, seeing it as an energy \u000d\u000awhich exists just beyond our human realm, and \u000d\u000awhich might visit any one of us if we are lucky and \u000d\u000apaying attention.\u000d\u000aAnd whilst these kinds of magical fairy gifts may \u000d\u000abe unusual events, their ripple effect can be felt \u000d\u000athrough the generations. Theresa MacLellan \u000d\u000aabsorbed the music from her father and inspired it \u000d\u000ain Shelly who is now a celebrated player and \u000d\u000adedicated, inspirational teacher herself. One \u000d\u000aparticipant at Air Ch\u00e9ilidh acknowledged the time \u000d\u000aand effort that goes into honing one's creative \u000d\u000askills. \u201cThank you, Shelly and Glenn,\u201d they said, \u000d\u000a\u201cfor your inspiration and all the practicing that \u000d\u000abrought you to the place you are.\u201d Many other \u000d\u000acomments echoed this sentiment: a recognition \u000d\u000athat the dedication and generosity embodied by \u000d\u000amany musicians is a magic in and of itself.\u000d\u000aAll join hands!\u000d\u000aAnother realm in which the community comes \u000d\u000atogether across the generations is at square \u000d\u000adances. These social dances rose to prominence \u000d\u000aduring the 1930s when community halls were \u000d\u000abuilt and French quadrilles, popular in New \u000d\u000aEngland at the time, were brought back to Gaelic \u000d\u000acommunities by people returning from working \u000d\u000aaway. Each community developed distinct sets \u000d\u000aand after ceding to the craze of \u201cPig \u2019n\u2019 Whistle\u201d\u000d\u000adances in the 1970s, square dancing made a \u000d\u000acomeback in the late 1980s. The dance can be seen \u000d\u000aas a kind of metaphor for the way individual \u000d\u000acreativity and established traditions support each \u000d\u000aother in Gaelic culture. The movement patterns of \u000d\u000athe square sets, though they have changed \u000d\u000agradually through the years, are familiar and \u000d\u000apredictable to local dancers. Within the sets, \u000d\u000a20","though, and especially in the Mabou/Inverness \u000d\u000aCounty Set, the opportunity to step dance at \u000d\u000avarious points gives each dancer a chance to \u000d\u000aimprovise creatively in the moment.\u000d\u000aIn Season 1, Session 4, host Margie Beaton \u000d\u000agathered a small crew of dancers\u2014Mary Janet \u000d\u000aMacDonald, Dale Gillis and Margie MacInnis\u2014to \u000d\u000areminisce and celebrate the tradition of square \u000d\u000adancing. The West Mabou Hall hosts one of Cape \u000d\u000aBreton\u2019s longest running and most popular family \u000d\u000adances, and all three guests have a strong affection \u000d\u000afor it. Margie MacInnis\u2019s late husband, Jimmy, \u000d\u000astarted the dance in 1988, and it was in that hall \u000d\u000athat Dale Gillis danced his first set. He\u2019s been \u000d\u000ahooked ever since. It is the joy of the dancing, and \u000d\u000athe people, that keeps him coming back. \u201cA square \u000d\u000adance is happy music,\u201d he said, \u201cit's got drive to \u000d\u000ait\u2014I don't always see that in other places.\u201d\u000d\u000aParticipants on the call agreed: \u201cDale was so right \u000d\u000aabout the happiness effect at the dances, the \u000d\u000amusic, the community\u201d, \u201c[I was moved by] how \u000d\u000aconnected the music, dance and Gaelic language \u000d\u000aare and how good that feels in my heart, to be part \u000d\u000aof a deep, beautiful, integrated culture.\u201d Margie \u000d\u000aMacInnis also spoke of the fun, good exercise and \u000d\u000amood-boost a dance could provide. \u201cI met so many \u000d\u000anice people,\u201d she said. \u201cSome evenings I wouldn't \u000d\u000afeel like going but once I would go, I would always \u000d\u000ahave fun. You could guarantee that.\u201d\u000d\u000aSquare dance in Glencoe [image credit: M\u00e0iri Britton]\u000d\u000aWhile there are several adult dances in Cape \u000d\u000aBreton where alcohol is sold, Margie spoke of the \u000d\u000aimportance of keeping the West Mabou hall open \u000d\u000ato youth. She shared a poem she wrote for the \u000d\u000adances, after Jimmy died suddenly in 2016. Two of \u000d\u000athe lines speak to this intergenerational \u000d\u000aimportance:\u000d\u000aPeople of all ages dancing together, he observed,\u000d\u000aLeading to our culture and traditions being \u000d\u000apreserved.\u000d\u000a\u201cThis has been so wonderful tonight!\u201d one \u000d\u000aparticipant commented at the end of the session, \u000d\u000a\u201cJust thinking about the wonderful spirit in the \u000d\u000ahalls and the great times with friends and family \u000d\u000aand the music with the floor bouncing. Drive 'er!\u201d \u000d\u000aReflecting on the first series of Air Ch\u00e9ilidh, host \u000d\u000aMike Kennedy spoke of how he sensed concentric \u000d\u000acircles of energy lifting at a dance, as the musicians \u000d\u000aand dancers fed a joyful feedback loop throughout \u000d\u000athe night. He said he felt the same energy during \u000d\u000athe Air Ch\u00e9ilidh sessions, as conversations \u000d\u000abetween hosts and guests sparked connections \u000d\u000abetween participants as far removed as Scotland \u000d\u000aand California, Cape Breton and Brazil. The dance \u000d\u000acaller\u2019s cry of \u201call join hands\u201d captures something \u000d\u000aof this spirit of connection and transmission, \u000d\u000aforming a circle through which to share rhythm, \u000d\u000aenergy and the sense of well-being which comes \u000d\u000afrom driving tunes and joyful, synchronised \u000d\u000amovement. \u000d\u000aFor the fun of it\u000d\u000aThe dance hall is an important place where people \u000d\u000aget to goof off and personalities shine through. \u000d\u000aOutside the dancehall, people gather in the \u000d\u000aparking lot to drink and tell stories, often long \u000d\u000aafter the dance has ended. Certain storytellers \u000d\u000aearn a reputation for their sharp wit, memory and \u000d\u000aability to conjure a person from thin air through \u000d\u000atheir impersonations.\u000d\u000aIs fhe\u00e0irrde duine g\u00e0ire\u000d\u000aA person is all the better for laughing\u000d\u000aThis nuanced, intimate humour became the focus \u000d\u000aof another of Margie Beaton\u2019s sessions as she \u000d\u000ainvited two comedic master-crafters to talk about \u000d\u000atheir creative processes. Kate Beaton (\u201cKatie\u201d to \u000d\u000athe home crowd) and Peter MacInnis (son to \u000d\u000aMargie and Jimmy of the West Mabou Hall) are \u000d\u000a21","widely renowned as individual artists, but in\u000d\u000aSeason 4, Session 4 they stressed that their skills \u000d\u000aare part of a rich sense of collective culture which \u000d\u000astarted within their families, and developed under \u000d\u000athe influence of the wider community.\u000d\u000aBoth Peter and Katie have an exceptional ability to \u000d\u000a\u201ctake people off,\u201d or mimic them, whether through \u000d\u000acharacter acting or cartoons. They spoke of how \u000d\u000athe familiarity of generation upon generation \u000d\u000agrowing up together creates an intimate knowing \u000d\u000athat allows people to mimic each other with \u000d\u000aimpressive and often hilarious accuracy. Peter \u000d\u000amentioned that if he sees an idiosyncrasy in \u000d\u000asomeone, he will often practice it and possibly\u000d\u000aborrow it for one of his character sketches. Katie \u000d\u000aadded that a person might spend an hour in church \u000d\u000alooking at the back of another person\u2019s head, a \u000d\u000apractice of paying attention which has translated \u000d\u000ainto her highly evocative drawings.\u000d\u000aKatie acknowledged that there might be an \u000d\u000aelement of this kind of humour that seems \u000d\u000a\u201cexclusive\u201d and hard for outsiders to understand.\u000d\u000aBut she explained that \u201cpeople are making jokes \u000d\u000afor each other, for ourselves,\u201d they are not \u000d\u000anecessarily thinking about how to perform to, or \u000d\u000aentertain, a wider audience. \u000d\u000aThis is a humour rooted in a Gaelic sensibility, the \u000d\u000asame sensibility which shapes humorous songs \u000d\u000aabout neighbours and funny events that happen in \u000d\u000athe community. It is a tradition which continues \u000d\u000atoday in Nova Scotia with friends composing puirt\u00e1-beul for each other on their birthdays. Dale Gillis \u000d\u000areceived one, to the tune of the Scottsville Reel (his \u000d\u000ahometown). The chorus asks \u201cC\u00e0\u2019 bheil Dale anns \u000d\u000aan d\u00f9thaich? C\u00e0\u2019 bheil Dale anns an t-saoghal? | \u000d\u000aWhere is Dale in the country? Where is Dale in the \u000d\u000aworld?\u201d and answers that, of course, \u201cBidh e far a \u000d\u000abheil an ce\u00f2l | He will be where the music is!\u201d\u000d\u000aIs fhe\u00e0rr na\u2019n t-\u00f2r sgeul innse air ch\u00f2ir\u000d\u000aBetter than gold is a tale well told\u000d\u000aHumour has long been a mediator of social \u000d\u000arelations and a means by which community values \u000d\u000aare established and maintained. As Katie pointed \u000d\u000aout, \u201cIf you were known to be really sharp or really \u000d\u000awitty that\u2019s better than being the richest person in \u000d\u000atown. People will be like, \u2018I respect that person.\u2019\u201d \u000d\u000aHumour keeps people on the level: \u201cIf someone \u000d\u000acame around with a fat head, they\u2019d be at the \u000d\u000abottom of the pile no matter what they did!\u201d To \u000d\u000aillustrate this, Katie told a story of a fella who\u2014\u000d\u000aindicating his cows heading out to the fields\u2014\u000d\u000aboasted that he had the nicest cows on Mabou \u000d\u000aRidge. Immediately, local wit, Angus Joe, replied, \u000d\u000a\u201cWell, if you do, you should let them out too.\u201d Katie \u000d\u000amimicked perfectly the dry, slow, understated \u000d\u000adelivery.\u000d\u000aReclamation\u000d\u000aThroughout the seasons of Air Ch\u00e9ilidh,\u000d\u000aparticipants thought about how our songs, stories \u000d\u000aand creative expressions give us an alternative \u000d\u000aperspective through which to see the world.\u000d\u000aHaving the creative freedom to express oneself in \u000d\u000aone\u2019s chosen language was mentioned as being of \u000d\u000agreat importance to some in their decolonization \u000d\u000aand cultural reclamation work. Participants \u000d\u000avoiced the loss that they felt from having grown up \u000d\u000awithout their native language, and the healing that \u000d\u000acame from starting to reclaim it. Far from being \u000d\u000a\u201cirrelevant,\u201d as the mainstream narrative often \u000d\u000aimplies, these minority languages are ecosystems \u000d\u000aof the mind, offering wisdom and creative \u000d\u000ainspiration to those who explore them. Sa\u2019n Sulian \u000d\u000a| John William \u201cTiny\u201d Cremo summed this up \u000d\u000asimply and evocatively when he said \u201cmy ideas are \u000d\u000afrom the L'nu side of my brain\u201d (Season 2, Session \u000d\u000a7).\u000d\u000aIt\u2019s not just language, either. Mi\u2019kmaw dancers \u000d\u000aSusan Copage and Sarah Prosper spoke in Season \u000d\u000a3, Session 2 and Season 4, Session 5, respectively, \u000d\u000aabout how learning and practicing traditional and \u000d\u000acontemporary Mi\u2019kmaw dance is a vital part of \u000d\u000atheir cultural and personal self-expression. \u000d\u000aSusan recalled how her father started to teach her \u000d\u000ato dance: \u201cMy dad looked at me and said: \u2018You are \u000d\u000aMi\u2019kmaq.\u2019 I said, \u2018I know, Dad.\u2019 He goes, \u2018It is time \u000d\u000ayou learned how to be Mi\u2019kmaq.\u2019 And he got up and \u000d\u000ataught me how to do the first dance that I had ever \u000d\u000aseen, which was the Koju\u2019a.\u201d During Centralization,\u000d\u000athe government tried to move all Mi\u2019kmaq to two \u000d\u000areserves, Shubenacadie and Eskasoni, but some \u000d\u000apeople stayed back in We\u2019koqma\u2019q, including \u000d\u000a22","Susan\u2019s grandfather, and hid their kids in the \u000d\u000awoods. They kept up traditional practices like \u000d\u000adancing, which Indian Affairs Agents frowned \u000d\u000aupon.\u000d\u000a\u201cThe Indian Agents would end up coming over to \u000d\u000araid their homes, to make sure there was nothing \u000d\u000atraditional that the people left behind were doing . \u000d\u000a. . that they were acting \u2018civilized,\u2019 I guess,\u201d Susan \u000d\u000arecalled. She explained how at that time the \u000d\u000aMi\u2019kmaq did not use the drum, but rather an \u000d\u000ainstrument called the ji'kmaqn, which they made \u000d\u000afrom a round of a spruce tree. \u201cSo, when the Indian \u000d\u000aAgent came, because these instruments would be \u000d\u000aso easy to make, they would either be thrown into \u000d\u000aa fire or they would be put upside down into a \u000d\u000abucket beside the fire to look like a piece of \u000d\u000akindling.\u201d Susan\u2019s story resonates with some \u000d\u000aGaelic memories of particularly zealous priests \u000d\u000aand ministers who were so opposed to traditional \u000d\u000amusic and dancing they would confiscate, and \u000d\u000aeven destroy, people\u2019s instruments. Luckily, they\u000d\u000awere not particularly successful. \u000d\u000aIn the wake of such oppression, there is sometimes \u000d\u000athe desire to protect and preserve what was \u000d\u000athreatened, which can, in turn, develop into a new \u000d\u000akind of stifling. Contemporary dancer and \u000d\u000achoreographer, Sarah explained how she finds \u000d\u000abalance in her practice by drawing from two wells. \u000d\u000a\u201cTraditional and contemporary ways of knowing \u000d\u000acan be mixed\u2014they have to be,\u201d she said. \u201cYou \u000d\u000acan\u2019t exist without tradition, and you can\u2019t go \u000d\u000aforward and make new things without \u000d\u000acontemporary ways of knowing. I try not to feel \u000d\u000alike there\u2019s one answer, because there isn\u2019t.\u201d\u000d\u000aBetter to try than to hope\u000d\u000aMany commented that they left the Air Ch\u00e9ilidh \u000d\u000acalls feeling inspired to bring more creativity into \u000d\u000atheir lives. In a time when our traditions of \u000d\u000acollective entertainment have faded and most of \u000d\u000aus are increasingly becoming consumers of \u000d\u000aentertainment rather than creators of it, it was \u000d\u000aexciting to feel the reenergizing of our collective \u000d\u000acreativity through the sessions.\u000d\u000a\u2019S fhe\u00e0rr fheuchainn na bhith \u2019s an d\u00f9il\u000d\u000aBetter to start than to hope\u000d\u000aFor some starting out on their language learning \u000d\u000ajourney, the stage of writing a story or composing \u000d\u000aa song in Gaelic might seem far off\u2014even fluent \u000d\u000aspeakers can find that thought daunting! But, as \u000d\u000aM\u00e0iri S\u00ecne NicLaomuinn | Mary Jane Lamond \u000d\u000aspoke to in Season 4, Session 1, we are blessed to \u000d\u000ahave archives stacked with recordings which \u000d\u000adocument the collective memory and creativity of \u000d\u000athe generations who have gone before us. \u000d\u000aThousands of hours of tales, songs, anecdotes, \u000d\u000ainstrumental music, descriptions of crafts and \u000d\u000aother offerings are available online through sites \u000d\u000asuch as Cainnt is Ceathramhan, The Beaton \u000d\u000aInstitute, An Drochaid Eadarainn, Tobar an \u000d\u000aDualchais and the Digital Archive of Scottish Gaelic\u000d\u000a(see Resources Appendix for more). \u000d\u000aThe Gaelic aesthetic tells us that you don\u2019t need to \u000d\u000ahave a \u201cstage voice\u201d to captivate listeners with a \u000d\u000asong sung with emotional sensitivity, clear \u000d\u000aarticulation and a good swing. The process of deep \u000d\u000alistening, interpretation and sharing of material \u000d\u000aheld for hundreds of years in collective memory \u000d\u000asits alongside and informs the creation of new \u000d\u000aworks of art. Both are of equal value and offer their \u000d\u000aown paths to cultural grounding, catharsis and \u000d\u000aregeneration.\u000d\u000aThe sessions of Air Ch\u00e9ilidh were a collective, \u000d\u000acreative act in dreaming up how the next chapters \u000d\u000aof our story will be written. Many spoke of how \u000d\u000aNova Scotia Gaelic culture offers an alternative to \u000d\u000aexclusive, hierarchical funneling of creative \u000d\u000aexpression. The dances are easy to learn and open \u000d\u000ato all. Friends and neighbors are ready to \u000d\u000aencourage new musicians through the years of \u000d\u000alearning to become the players of the future. The \u000d\u000aarchived voices of ancestors are waiting to guide \u000d\u000aand inspire. Our communities are full of \u000d\u000astorytellers, musicians, writers, weavers, jokers, \u000d\u000acooks, dancers and more, many of whom are yet to \u000d\u000adiscover their passions and talents. We can create \u000d\u000awhat we need to sustain ourselves and each other. \u000d\u000a23","7. Beathachadh | Sustenance\u000d\u000aIn an age of simultaneous scarcity and \u000d\u000aoverproduction, what does it mean to be deeply \u000d\u000anourished, to sustain ourselves and each other?\u000d\u000aHow do we sustain our language, customs and \u000d\u000acreative expressions? And how do we ensure that \u000d\u000athere will be enough for the generations who come \u000d\u000aafter us? Season Two of Air Ch\u00e9ilidh centred \u000d\u000aaround the theme of gu le\u00f2r, a Gaelic phrase which \u000d\u000ameans both \u201cenough\u201d and \u201cplenty.\u201d It speaks of a \u000d\u000asense of balanced moderation and abundance, the \u000d\u000atrue worth of having our deepest needs met for \u000d\u000anourishment, shelter, safety and connection. And \u000d\u000athe topic was not limited to Season Two, either. \u000d\u000aThroughout all the seasons of Air Ch\u00e9ilidh, the\u000d\u000ahosts and guests considered and celebrated the \u000d\u000amany ways Gaelic does, or could, nourish and \u000d\u000aenhance our lives.\u000d\u000aBlas na G\u00e0idhlig | The taste of Gaelic\u000d\u000aIn Session 7 of Season 3, host Sionainn ni'n \u000d\u000aAonghais Iain Pheadair | Shannon MacMullin \u000d\u000aintroduced us to her beloved mentor and \u000d\u000ahonorary Grandmother, Annag ni\u2019n Iain Alasdair \u000d\u000a\u2019ic Aonghais Ailein | Anna MacKinnon from Broad \u000d\u000aCove, Inverness. Annag has been a generous and \u000d\u000ainspiring Gaelic guide for many, delighting them \u000d\u000awith her warmth, wit and outrageous sense of \u000d\u000ahumour. Despite never having much in the way of \u000d\u000amaterial possessions, she is filled with the riches \u000d\u000aof her language and culture and willingly shares \u000d\u000athese treasures with anyone who is interested. \u000d\u000aThe Gaelic language has nourished Annag since \u000d\u000abirth. As she says, \u201c\u2019S i a\u2019 Gh\u00e0idhlig a\u2019 chiad bhiadh \u000d\u000aa dh\u2019ith mi | Gaelic is the first food that I ate.\u201d It is \u000d\u000aone of the reasons she has never turned her back \u000d\u000aon the language and has defended it fiercely from \u000d\u000acritics and nay-sayers.\u000d\u000aIn a prerecorded interview with Shannon for Air \u000d\u000aCh\u00e9ilidh, Annag flared with defiance remembering \u000d\u000awhen she worked at the store in Inverness and\u000d\u000acertain customers would ask, \u201cdo you talk that \u000d\u000agarbage too?\u201d \u201cDh\u2019fhalbh sradagan asam! | the \u000d\u000asparks flew off me!\u201d she exclaimed. And yet,\u000d\u000asomehow, she managed to resist the shame which \u000d\u000acould so easily have crept in through these\u000d\u000arepeated put-downs. Instead, she holds firm to her \u000d\u000abelief in the value of her d\u00f9thchas | heritage and \u000d\u000ahonours it by sharing it. She has left lasting \u000d\u000aimpressions on so many who have had the\u000d\u000apleasure to learn from her. As Shannon said, \u201cShe \u000d\u000ais one of the many who have offered me a shoulder\u000d\u000ato stand on, and I carry her with me in so many \u000d\u000aways.\u201d\u000d\u000aAnna MacKinnon & Shannon MacMullin\u000d\u000aGaelic grounds Annag in a sense of place, \u000d\u000abelonging, family and fun. \u201cDar a chluinneas mi \u000d\u000a\u00f2rain Gh\u00e0idhlig, ch\u00ec mi an taigh nam inntinn | When \u000d\u000aI hear Gaelic songs, I see the house in my mind,\u201d \u000d\u000ashe says, referring to the house she was born in, in \u000d\u000aSight Point. The kind of wicked humour she can\u000d\u000aexpress so freely in her native language is one of \u000d\u000athe reasons she believes she has lived so long (she \u000d\u000ais 91 at the time of writing). \u201cGun sp\u00f2rs tha a\u2019 \u000d\u000acheart cho math dhut a bhith marbh | Without fun \u000d\u000ayou might as well be dead!\u201d she chuckles. It is clear \u000d\u000athat Gaelic has sustained her in more ways than \u000d\u000aone.\u000d\u000aIn Season 1, Session 3, Joyce MacDonald also spoke \u000d\u000aof the nourishment Gaelic holds for her, and her \u000d\u000adesire to share this with others. \u201cI\u2019m not interested \u000d\u000a24","in \u2018preserving\u2019 Gaelic,\u201d she explained, \u201cI want to \u000d\u000alive in Gaelic. I don\u2019t want to put it in a jar and stick\u000d\u000ait in the cold storage room for later. I\u2019m going to \u000d\u000aput it on some biscuits and give it out to people!\u201d \u000d\u000aJoyce\u2019s vibrant metaphor highlights two priorities \u000d\u000awithin minority language planning. There are \u000d\u000asalvage and conservation efforts to try to save and \u000d\u000afix in time what has come before. And alongside \u000d\u000athem, there are revitalisation efforts to try to boost \u000d\u000aspeaker numbers, expand vocabulary and increase \u000d\u000acapacity in the language. Both are important, but\u000d\u000afor much of the 20th century there was perhaps \u000d\u000amore of a focus on the former than the latter. As \u000d\u000aJoyce points out, we need to live, share and allow \u000d\u000aGaelic to nourish us in real time if we are to ensure \u000d\u000aits continued presence as a living language.\u000d\u000aPlant your own potatoes\u000d\u000aWe can sustain Gaelic, and it will continue to \u000d\u000asustain us. This was an abiding and inspiring \u000d\u000anarrative which emerged from the conversation \u000d\u000abetween guests Anne B. Ryan and Mary Jane \u000d\u000aLamond as they spoke to host Frances MacEachen \u000d\u000ain Season 2, Session 2. They highlighted the \u000d\u000aresilience and self-sufficiency present within the \u000d\u000aGaelic culture, and how it can equip us with tools \u000d\u000aand values we need to navigate the challenges of \u000d\u000aour modern lives.\u000d\u000aMary Jane commented that, until the 1890s and \u000d\u000athe arrival of the railway, much of people\u2019s daily \u000d\u000alives in Cape Breton were built around a cashless \u000d\u000aeconomy of hunting, growing food, building and \u000d\u000abartering for supplies. This has changed rapidly in \u000d\u000athe last 130 years, but the land still offers \u000d\u000aabundance to those who work with it. While the \u000d\u000aglobalized world and its complexities can \u000d\u000asometimes feel overwhelming, we considered \u000d\u000aways to simplify and localise our decision-making \u000d\u000aand our impact. Small-scale food security and \u000d\u000abuilding projects, guided by the principles of \u000d\u000areciprocity and gu le\u00f2r, can help us stay grounded \u000d\u000aand well-resourced. Mary Jane shared the simple \u000d\u000aand wise advice of her neighbour to start small and \u000d\u000aclose to home: \u201cYou just need to plant your own \u000d\u000apotatoes!\u201d\u000d\u000aNourished by home\u000d\u000aMary Jane also spoke of the importance of \u000d\u000a\u201cknowing one\u2019s place,\u201d not as a limitation, but in \u000d\u000athe sense of anxiety-soothing groundedness and \u000d\u000abelonging. Speaking of friend and respected Gaelic \u000d\u000aelder, Peter Jack MacLean, she commented how \u000d\u000a\u201che just knew his place in the world . . . there was \u000d\u000ano kind of angst about it.\u201d \u000d\u000aSometimes, though, it helps to venture further \u000d\u000aafield to fully appreciate what sustains you from \u000d\u000ahome. This arose as a key theme in Season 1, \u000d\u000aSession 6 and Season 4, Session 4 as Kenneth \u000d\u000aMacKenzie, Kate Beaton and Peter MacInnis\u000d\u000areflected on how their time spent travelling and \u000d\u000aliving abroad has shaped their sense of home. \u000d\u000aAll three grew up in Mabou but have worked and \u000d\u000atravelled to many other parts of the world. Peter\u000d\u000areflected that it was only when he returned from \u000d\u000aworking for a spell in England that it really hit him \u000d\u000ahow the people in his community have a particular \u000d\u000aaccent and unique mannerisms, and how \u000d\u000asignificant this was to the humour of the place. He \u000d\u000acame to appreciate the local Freshmart as a hub of \u000d\u000acharacters and entertaining interactions and\u000d\u000awould make a point of bringing visiting friends \u000d\u000athere so they could experience its charm for \u000d\u000athemselves.\u000d\u000aAm fear as fhaide chaidh bho'n bhaile,\u000d\u000achual\u2019 e \u2019n ce\u00f2l bu mhilse leis nuair thill e\u000d\u000adhachaidh.\u000d\u000aHe who went the furthest from home,\u000d\u000aheard the sweetest music on his return.\u000d\u000aKenneth, who is a musician and director of the \u000d\u000aBeinn Mh\u00e0bu campus of Colaisde na G\u00e0idhlig | The \u000d\u000aGaelic College, told a story of travelling in South \u000d\u000aAmerica in his twenties. For all the fun and \u000d\u000aadventures he was having, he eventually found \u000d\u000ahimself gravitating with increasing frequency \u000d\u000atowards internet caf\u00e9s so he could listen to tapes \u000d\u000aof Cape Breton fiddlers on YouTube. \u201cAfter a while, \u000d\u000aI realized, \u2018what am I doing in an internet caf\u00e9 in \u000d\u000aBogot\u00e1 listening to Willie Kennedy when I could be \u000d\u000ahome?!\u2019\u201d He remembers that as the moment Gaelic \u000d\u000a\u201cgrabbed\u201d him, and he understood its importance \u000d\u000ain his life.\u000d\u000a25","When people ask Kate why, as a world-renowned \u000d\u000acartoonist, she doesn\u2019t live in Toronto or New \u000d\u000aYork, she replies, \u201cI feel more myself here at \u000d\u000ahome [in Mabou] than I do anywhere else, I\u2019m a \u000d\u000aversion of myself that feels more authentic . . . it\u2019s \u000d\u000anot just me, it\u2019s me inside my community.\u201d\u000d\u000aEnough to share\u000d\u000aIn Season 2, Session 1, guest Hector MacNeil \u000d\u000aconsidered the meaning of gu le\u00f2r and how he \u000d\u000aremembers the concept being embodied by the \u000d\u000aGaels around him through countless acts of \u000d\u000ahumble generosity. \u201cNuair a chanas tu \u2018gu le\u00f2r\u2019, tha \u000d\u000athu a\u2019 cantail d\u00e0 rud aig an aon \u00e0m | When you say \u000d\u000agu le\u00f2r you\u2019re saying two things at the same time,\u201d \u000d\u000ahe said. \u201cTha gu le\u00f2r agam, agus tha poidhle agam. \u000d\u000aTha thu a\u2019 cantail an aon rud, gun a bhith \u000d\u000asmaointinn air | I have enough, and I have a lot. \u000d\u000aYou\u2019re saying the same thing, without thinking \u000d\u000aabout it.\u201d\u000d\u000aGrowing up in the mid-sixties, Hector \u000d\u000aremembered how \u201ccha robh pailteas de s\u00econ \u000d\u000aagainne . . . ach bha gu le\u00f2r ann | We didn\u2019t have a \u000d\u000agreat amount of anything . . . but there was \u000d\u000aenough.\u201d When his family moved from Sydney to \u000d\u000aCastlebay, the area was still full of small farms and \u000d\u000apeople grew what they ate. He remembers fishing \u000d\u000afor cod and bringing in hay and the sense of \u000d\u000aabundance that gave him. Life was simpler and \u000d\u000asmall things had big impacts, like the time the \u000d\u000astore got a new type of baloney, and everyone was \u000d\u000aexcited to try it. \u201cFhuair sinn am baloney beag agus \u000d\u000aDhia bha e math.

The way his grandfather and aunt \u000d\u000amade supper every night for a pair of brothers \u000d\u000awho lived nearby and had cognitive challenges. \u000d\u000aThe brothers were poor and deathly afraid of fire \u000d\u000aand so were unable to cook for themselves. They \u000d\u000awould come round every single evening for \u000d\u000asupper, and when one was sick Hector\u2019s aunt \u000d\u000avisited his house every day to nurse him through \u000d\u000athe winter.\u000d\u000aThese simple acts demonstrate the values of the \u000d\u000aGaelic community he grew up in, values of \u000d\u000ahospitality and mutual care which resonated \u000d\u000athroughout the Air Ch\u00e9ilidh gatherings. The \u000d\u000aconcept of \u201cgu le\u00f2r\u201d helped us to think about what \u000d\u000areally matters to us, and how we can use that \u000d\u000aknowledge to nourish our own communities and \u000d\u000aconnect with others. \u000d\u000aKenneth believes that his connection to his own \u000d\u000aculture has helped him to develop even more \u000d\u000aempathy and appreciation for other cultures as \u000d\u000awell. \u201cValues that are important to us as Gaels are \u000d\u000avalues important to many cultures, folk cultures, \u000d\u000aaround the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you dig into it, it\u2019s \u000d\u000amore apparent that we are more similar than \u000d\u000adifferent. That\u2019s what I hope comes out of this \u000d\u000arevitalization . . . the more we know about \u000d\u000aourselves, the more we can connect to others: as \u000d\u000aindividuals, as a collective, as a community.\u201d\u000d\u000aAnne Ryan commented how \u201cenough is about \u000d\u000aseveral things: it brings together ecology and \u000d\u000aethics and aesthetics and economics . . . In healthy \u000d\u000aecological systems you have a lot of diversity, so I \u000d\u000athink it\u2019s absolutely essential that we . . . have a \u000d\u000adiversity of language in the world, particularly the \u000d\u000alanguage that are connected to Indigenous\u000d\u000aknowledge.\u201d\u000d\u000aAt the feasting table\u000d\u000aGaelic is often poetically referred to as an c\u00e0nan \u000d\u000ace\u00f2lmhor blasda binn | the musical, tasty, \u000d\u000amelodious language, echoing a line from a song by \u000d\u000athe B\u00e0rd MacLean, \u201cBithibh Aotrom is Togaibh \u000d\u000aFonn.\u201d The words feel good in the mouth. As \u000d\u000aAnnag said, they are a kind of food that can sustain \u000d\u000ayour soul and that you can share with others, \u000d\u000awhatever the amount of Gaelic you have. We can \u000d\u000ause their essence to shore up our spirit against the \u000d\u000akinds of dismissive ignorance Anna experienced,\u000d\u000aand to sustain us through hard times and joyful \u000d\u000aones. We can invite others to the feasting table, \u000d\u000atoo\u2014there is enough and enough to share.\u000d\u000a26","8. Ionnsachadh | Learning\u000d\u000aSince the start of the 20th century, when Gaelic \u000d\u000awas spoken by an estimated 100,000 people in \u000d\u000aNova Scotia, the language has dwindled to around \u000d\u000a2,000 speakers, a decline of 98%. One of the \u000d\u000astrongest and most pervasive narratives \u000d\u000asurrounding Gaelic during the last century has \u000d\u000abeen that it is ill-suited to the demands of an \u000d\u000aincreasingly globalised, technological and \u000d\u000afinancially focused world. Many internalised the \u000d\u000abelief that, at best, Gaelic would do nothing to \u000d\u000aimprove your economic and social situation, and,\u000d\u000aat worst, it would actively hinder your chances. \u000d\u000aParents were told explicitly that speaking their \u000d\u000anative language to their children would hold them \u000d\u000aback and damage their developing grasp of \u000d\u000aEnglish, \u201cthe language of the future.\u201d Children \u000d\u000awere admonished and punished for speaking \u000d\u000aGaelic in school\u2014sometimes by teachers who \u000d\u000awere Gaelic-speakers themselves\u2014and parents \u000d\u000abegan to use Gaelic as a code language to talk over \u000d\u000athe heads of the children. The next generation \u000d\u000agrew up with an English speech cadence still \u000d\u000asinging with Gaelic inflections, but for most the \u000d\u000alanguage was an echo, like a melody you can hear \u000d\u000ain your head but cannot sing aloud.\u000d\u000aThere have always been those who resisted, but \u000d\u000afor a while it felt they were swimming against a \u000d\u000ariptide. In the past few decades, though, a \u000d\u000acombination of personal healing, collective \u000d\u000aadvocacy and remarkable determination have\u000d\u000atransformed the narrative around Gaelic in Nova \u000d\u000aScotia. It is now well understood that secondlanguage acquisition (of any kind) improves, \u000d\u000arather than limits, cognitive development, and \u000d\u000aNova Scotia Gaels have successfully campaigned to \u000d\u000aestablish Gaelic in the school curriculum. There is\u000d\u000aan independent Gaelic-medium primary school, \u000d\u000athe first of its kind in North America, and Gaelic \u000d\u000arepresentation in government, on the radio and in \u000d\u000athe arts. Perhaps most importantly, Gaelic is being \u000d\u000aspoken again more widely in homes and at \u000d\u000acommunity gatherings around the province. This \u000d\u000ais due in no small part to a collection of mentorship \u000d\u000aprograms and the devoted and passionate \u000d\u000aindividuals who have made them a success.\u000d\u000aAn t-ionnsachadh b\u00f2idheach | The beautiful \u000d\u000alearning\u000d\u000aThe Bun is B\u00e0rr | Root and Branch program is \u000d\u000afunded by Gaelic Affairs Nova Scotia and\u000d\u000aencompasses three streams of mentorship: \u201cNa \u000d\u000aGaisgich \u00d2ga | The Young Heroes\u201d for youth aged \u000d\u000a8-16, delivered by Colaisde na G\u00e0idhlig | The \u000d\u000aGaelic College; \u201cDaltachas | Fostership,\u201d a \u000d\u000apredominately online offering for intermediate \u000d\u000alearners, and the eponymous \u201cBun is B\u00e0rr\u201d\u000d\u000aprogram which pairs advanced learners with \u000d\u000aGaelic elders/native speakers to form lasting \u000d\u000abonds of learning and friendship. \u000d\u000aMany of the individuals involved in Air Ch\u00e9ilidh as \u000d\u000ahosts, guests and participants have benefitted \u000d\u000afrom one or more of these programs. Pairings such \u000d\u000aas Migi John H. and Colin Watson (Season 1, \u000d\u000aSession 5), Mary MacKinnon and Carmen \u000d\u000aMacArthur (Season 2, Session 6) or Shannon \u000d\u000aMacMullin and Anna MacKinnon (Season 3, \u000d\u000aSession 7) demonstrate the remarkable growth of \u000d\u000alinguistic and cultural fluency the program can \u000d\u000anurture, not to mention the abiding affection\u000d\u000awhich often develops between the participants. \u000d\u000aThere is an expression in Gaelic, \u201can t-ionnsachadh \u000d\u000a\u00f2g, an t-ionnsachadh b\u00f2idheach | the young \u000d\u000a27","learning, the beautiful learning,\u201d and while this is \u000d\u000ano doubt true\u2014most of us would love to channel \u000d\u000athe unselfconscious ease with which very young \u000d\u000achildren learn language\u2014programs like Bun is \u000d\u000aB\u00e0rr have shown us that there is huge value in \u000d\u000asupporting adults in the process of language \u000d\u000alearning and reclamation as well. \u000d\u000aColin Watson & Migi John H. [image credit: Province of Nova Scotia]\u000d\u000aThe vision behind the program was inspired by the \u000d\u000awork of sociolinguists like Leanne Hinton (Season \u000d\u000a2, Session 4) and activists like the late Finlay \u000d\u000aMacLeod and the late Seumas Watson, who \u000d\u000aemphasised the importance of community-based \u000d\u000alearning, grassroots language revitalization \u000d\u000aefforts, and prioritizing adult learners so they can \u000d\u000athen teach the language to children. And it seems \u000d\u000ato be working. A small but mighty collection of \u000d\u000aadults learned Gaelic to fluency in the early 2000s, \u000d\u000aand many now have children who speak Gaelic as \u000d\u000aa mother tongue. Others have become teachers \u000d\u000aand mentors to other children and adults alike, \u000d\u000ahelping to grow linguistic and cultural fluency \u000d\u000athroughout the generations. Along with Leanne \u000d\u000aHinton, Gaelic teacher and parent, Bernard \u000d\u000aCameron, spoke of the importance of starting with \u000d\u000awhat you have and always remembering to play \u000d\u000aand have fun with the language-learning process. \u000d\u000a\u201cThe time [to start] is when you have one-word,\u201d \u000d\u000ahe encouraged, \u201cstart speaking it! . . . And then \u000d\u000apeople see the fun and fun stories that go with it.\u201d \u000d\u000aIn Season 4, Session 2, host Kieran Walker spoke \u000d\u000ato another Gaelic parent, Lodaidh MacFhionghain \u000d\u000a| Lewis MacKinnon, about how he reclaimed Gaelic \u000d\u000aas the language of his home. Growing up, Lewis felt \u000d\u000ahe carried his Gaelic heritage and language \u000d\u000aresponsibility as a burden. It was something he \u000d\u000avalued and took seriously, but it came with a \u000d\u000apainful awareness of the minoritization of his \u000d\u000aancestors. \u201cThose first years were heavy,\u201d he said. \u000d\u000aBut his decision to speak Gaelic exclusively to his \u000d\u000achildren when he became a father transformed his\u000d\u000afeelings around the language: \u201cI realized it was a \u000d\u000agift. The burden became light.\u201d\u000d\u000aLewis always knew he wanted to pass his Gaelic \u000d\u000alanguage and culture on to his children. He became \u000d\u000aa father when he and his wife, Si\u00f9saidh | Susan, \u000d\u000aadopted their sons in 2010. The boys were eight \u000d\u000aand six when they joined the family. For the first \u000d\u000ayear, Lewis spoke to them often about Gaelic and \u000d\u000aits importance to him, then one day he decided to \u000d\u000abite the bullet and switched to speaking to them \u000d\u000aentirely in Gaelic. He has spoken only a few words \u000d\u000aof English to them on about five occasions since \u000d\u000a2011.\u000d\u000aLearning one\u2019s heritage language can help a \u000d\u000aperson develop their sense of identity and \u000d\u000abelonging, offering a secure anchor to place, \u000d\u000acommunity and family. \u201cThese are the things that \u000d\u000aare sustainable over time,\u201d Lewis says, \u201c[they] \u000d\u000afoster a sense of self-worth, a sense of \u2018I matter, I \u000d\u000ahave a role, I have a place in my family, my \u000d\u000acommunity.\u2019\u201d Lewis hopes his boys now see Gaelic \u000d\u000aas \u201ca beautiful rich heritage which they can claim \u000d\u000aas their own.\u201d\u000d\u000aBy making Gaelic a central part of his life, Lewis \u000d\u000afeels he\u2019s become more grounded in his own \u000d\u000aidentity, and even more curious about others\u2019 \u000d\u000aexperience. He notices and appreciates when he \u000d\u000ahears other languages being spoken around him. \u000d\u000aInstead of asking people where they\u2019re from, he \u000d\u000anow often asks what languages they speak and \u000d\u000afinds this question opens up much richer and more \u000d\u000ainteresting conversations. He and his gym buddy \u000d\u000acount each other's reps in Gaelic and Tamil, and \u000d\u000awhen he used to take his boys swimming, they \u000d\u000awould listen out for other parents speaking their \u000d\u000aheritage languages with their kids in the locker \u000d\u000arooms. \u201cI wanted [my boys] to know that this is \u000d\u000awhat humans do,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cWe\u2019re the same as \u000d\u000aother groups\u2014we have our language too . . . this is \u000d\u000awholesome and healthy.\u201d \u000d\u000a28","In Season 3, Session 1, host Mike Kennedy and his \u000d\u000aguest, Gaelic scholar Michael Newton, discussed \u000d\u000awhat has motivated Michael\u2019s long-standing \u000d\u000apassion for Gaelic. \u201cIt helps me feel that there is \u000d\u000asomething real in the world that is rooted, that has \u000d\u000athis cultural and social depth,\u201d Michael said. \u000d\u000aGrowing up in California, Michael\u2019s access to Gaelic \u000d\u000aculture was somewhat limited until he went to \u000d\u000aScotland to study. There, he developed a close \u000d\u000abond with the Gaelic scholar Iain mac Ruairidh \u2019ic \u000d\u000aIain \u2019ic N\u00e9ill | Dr. John MacInnes who was both \u000d\u000afriend and mentor to him. \u000d\u000aMichael is another adult learner who has raised a \u000d\u000afluent Gaelic-speaking child. He has spoken Gaelic \u000d\u000aexclusively to his now 12-year-old daughter since \u000d\u000ashe was born. They do not live close to any of the \u000d\u000aGaelic heartlands, but on a recent visit to Scotland, \u000d\u000aMichael was delighted that the social context ofthe \u000d\u000alanguage became more real and tangible for \u000d\u000aher. \u201cIt may be a minoritized language but there \u000d\u000aare people who are passionate about it, who\u000d\u000awelcomed her into their homes and will share \u000d\u000athings with her that she will never find anywhere \u000d\u000aelse.\"\u000d\u000aMichael Newton and a (younger) R\u00f3is\u00edn\u000d\u000aNa Gaisgich \u00d2ga | The Young Heroes \u000d\u000aIn Season 2, Session 5, Margie Beaton spoke to six \u000d\u000ayoung Gaels who are all passionate about learning, \u000d\u000asharing and celebrating their Gaelic language and \u000d\u000aculture. Abby Hanson, Abigail MacDonald, \u000d\u000aAlasdair Cameron, Hannah Krebs, Philip Whyte \u000d\u000aand Roddie MacInnis have all taken part in Na \u000d\u000aGaisgich \u00d2ga or other Bun is B\u00e0rr programs. Many \u000d\u000awere featured in a 2019 documentary about Gaelic \u000d\u000ayouth in Nova Scotia. At Air Ch\u00e9ilidh, they spoke \u000d\u000aabout all the reasons Gaelic is important to them, \u000d\u000awhat it has helped them learn about themselves \u000d\u000aand the world, and their hopes for its future. \u000d\u000aThey said they felt lucky to have opportunities to \u000d\u000alearn and experience Gaelic language and culture,\u000d\u000aaware that previous generations didn\u2019t have the \u000d\u000asame learning opportunities they have. They \u000d\u000adescribed a sense of community and fun and said \u000d\u000athey wished there could be many more funded \u000d\u000aprograms and grassroots events across the \u000d\u000aprovince so that more people could access what \u000d\u000athey have benefitted from. \u000d\u000aWhen thinking of moments that were examples of \u000d\u000a\u201cgu le\u00f2r,\u201d Philip commented that\u201cwhen it comes to \u000d\u000aGaelic, there are so many happy moments when \u000d\u000aI\u2019ve felt part of a community.\u201d Others shared \u000d\u000amoments when the language started to come \u000d\u000awithout translating, of texting a parent in Gaelic, \u000d\u000avisiting, singing songs and dancing. Roddie \u000d\u000aremembered the group singing T\u00e0ladh na Beinne \u000d\u000aGuirme | The Blue Mountain Lullaby at the end of \u000d\u000athe Na Gaisgich \u00d2ga program. \u201cIt felt so \u000d\u000aharmonious. It felt like we were our own little \u000d\u000acommunity, and it felt like we were strengthening \u000d\u000athe Gaelic language. It just felt beautiful.\u201d\u000d\u000aThey recognize their role in wider language and \u000d\u000aculture revitalization efforts and are \u201cdonning the \u000d\u000amantel\u201d enthusiastically. \u201cOur generation needs to \u000d\u000abe that next step,\u201d Roddie said, and they are \u000d\u000astepping forward. In the two years since their Air \u000d\u000aCh\u00e9ilidh session in 2022, they have all graduated \u000d\u000afrom school or university, and many are involved \u000d\u000ain regular teaching, music and cultural advocacy.\u000d\u000aHannah Krebs is a fine example.

Cuimhne | Memory\u000d\u000aCan you remember a moment when you suddenly realised that something you had struggled to learn had \u000d\u000afinally sunk into the marrow of your bones and no longer felt like effort?\u000d\u000aHow do you internalise and carry forward the things that matter most to you? \u000d\u000aWho or what in your life needs remembering?\u000d\u000aThese are questions which surfaced throughout Air Ch\u00e9ilidh, and as I (M\u00e0iri) have been compiling the stories \u000d\u000ain this book, I have found myself returning to them again and again. How can we carry forward the gifts of \u000d\u000aour time shared together? I hope this little collection of stories may help with that. In this final chapter, we \u000d\u000aclose out with the theme of memory, honouring all the people and events that have brought us to this \u000d\u000amoment, and considering what will guide us on the road ahead.\u000d\u000aAs a predominately oral culture, Gaels have honed \u000d\u000aand relied upon the keen memory of historykeepers, tradition-bearers and ordinary \u000d\u000acommunity members to share and pass on their \u000d\u000acollective knowledge, narratives and cultural \u000d\u000aexpressions. Through our sessions participants \u000d\u000amarvelled at the memory of tradition-bearers \u000d\u000arecorded in our archives, some of whom could \u000d\u000arecollect hundreds of songs and tales without ever \u000d\u000aseeing them written down. There was \u000d\u000aacknowledgement of how different our lives are \u000d\u000anow, living in a maelstrom of digital, externalized \u000d\u000ainformation, but how the process of listening to \u000d\u000aand memorising these archival recordings \u000d\u000aremains grounding and enriching. There was \u000d\u000aconsideration of how to best honour those who\u000d\u000ahave passed on their strengths to us, especially \u000d\u000athose who have perhaps not been properly \u000d\u000arecognized in our collective memory thus far. \u000d\u000aRemembering who we come from\u000d\u000aKin connections and cultural lineages are of great \u000d\u000aimportance to the Gaels. A person can usually \u000d\u000aname their sloinneadh | patronymic going back at \u000d\u000aleast four or five generations, and genealogists are \u000d\u000avalued knowledge-keepers in the community. \u000d\u000aEven the Gaelic phrase \u201cc\u00f3 \u00e1s a tha sibh?\u201d\u2014\u000d\u000atranslated as \u201cwhere are you from?\u201d\u2014really \u000d\u000ameans \u201cwho are you from,\u201d or \u201cwho are your \u000d\u000apeople?\u201d\u000d\u000aIn a similar way, a good tradition-bearer will \u000d\u000ausually introduce a song or story by mentioning its \u000d\u000aprovenance: who composed the song and the \u000d\u000aperson(s) from whom they heard it. It is a way of \u000d\u000ahonouring each strand of the basket which holds \u000d\u000aour collective wisdom.\u000d\u000aCuimhnich air na daoine bho\u2019n d\u2019th\u00e0inig thu\u000d\u000aRemember the people you came from\u000d\u000aIn Season 3, Session 7, Shannon MacMullin and\u000d\u000aSteiseag Nic Ill\u2019Eathain | Stacey MacLean spoke \u000d\u000aabout memory and the importance of \u000d\u000aremembering all the people who help you grow.\u000d\u000aThey highlighted the importance of fostership and \u000d\u000amentorship, alongside kinship ties, with beautiful \u000d\u000aexamples from their own lives. \u000d\u000aIs caomh le fear a charaid\u2019, ach \u2019s e smior a chridhe \u000d\u000aa chomh-dhalt\u000d\u000aA man loves his friend, but the very marrow of his \u000d\u000aheart is his foster-brother\u000d\u000aShannon spoke of her relationship with Anna \u000d\u000aMacKinnon, and Stacey talked of beloved Gaelic \u000d\u000amentors in Scotland who became like family and \u000d\u000asupported her over the years. One, in particular, an \u000d\u000a31","older gentleman called Tormod Dh\u00f2mhnaill N\u00ecll | \u000d\u000aNorman MacKillop of Berneray, adopted her like a \u000d\u000adaughter and welcomed her into his home for \u000d\u000amany visits in the 1990s. She recalled him taking \u000d\u000aher around the island and telling her stories about \u000d\u000apeople and history connected to landmarks or \u000d\u000acommunities. \u201cIt was so important to him that I \u000d\u000aremember, and I loved being quizzed . . . we fed off \u000d\u000aeach other. He got such a boost out of me \u000d\u000aremembering things, and I would get a boost out \u000d\u000aof him wanting to gift them to me.\u201d\u000d\u000aStacey said it surprised her at first how present \u000d\u000aand relevant history was for the Gaels on \u000d\u000aBerneray. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something that was off in the \u000d\u000adistant past that could only be understood in \u000d\u000abooks, but was lived and re-told all the time,\u201d she \u000d\u000aexplained. MacLeod, MacKillop and MacIver were \u000d\u000acommon family names on the island, and the\u000d\u000apeople there felt a strong affinity to the Norse part \u000d\u000aof their heritage, which dates to before the Middle \u000d\u000aAges. \u201cHe would speak about them as if they were \u000d\u000ahis cousins, like he knew them when he was \u000d\u000ayoung,\u201d she recalls.\u000d\u000aWhen Stacey returned to Berneray many years \u000d\u000alater, after Norman had passed away, she was \u000d\u000adismayed that it no longer felt so much like home. \u000d\u000a\u201cWhen I went back, I expected to go home, and it \u000d\u000awas because those people weren't there, \u000d\u000aespecially him, that it didn't feel like home.\u201d \u000d\u000aThere is a good kind of heartache, she said, which \u000d\u000areminds you that you loved something or someone \u000d\u000adeeply and it helps to keep the memory of them \u000d\u000aalive. \u201cThere are no monuments to these people,\u201d \u000d\u000ashe said. \u201cIt's so important that when you talk \u000d\u000aabout them, you are honouring them and \u000d\u000amemorializing them, not in a way that is a burden, \u000d\u000abut a celebration.\u201d\u000d\u000aThe connections of friendship and apprenticeship \u000d\u000abetween Shannon and Anna and Stacey and \u000d\u000aNorman moved and inspired many who were \u000d\u000alistening on the call. One participant commented,\u000d\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve been struck through these stories by the \u000d\u000ainfluence of mentors and elders, including people \u000d\u000anot necessarily from one\u2019s own immediate family. \u000d\u000aWe can all be those beacons for others.\u201d Another \u000d\u000areflected on how, \u201cthe love you both have for your \u000d\u000aelders and teachers is wonderful to see. Gaelic is \u000d\u000asuch a beautiful tradition in that way. Long may it \u000d\u000alive.\u201d\u000d\u000aVisiting the voices\u000d\u000aAs we mourn and remember the Gaelic elders who \u000d\u000ahave passed from us, we are lucky to still be able \u000d\u000ato listen to, and learn from, their voices as they are\u000d\u000apreserved in various archive collections. These \u000d\u000arecorded voices are like the echo of a visit\u2014they \u000d\u000alet us visit with the likes of E\u00f2s N\u00ecll Bhig | Joe Neil \u000d\u000aMacNeil or Mairead Bean Ruairidh | Margaret \u000d\u000aMacLean even if we never knew them when they \u000d\u000awere alive.\u000d\u000aIn the very first session of Air Ch\u00e9ilidh, Gaelic \u000d\u000afolklorist, Dr. John Shaw, spoke of his memories \u000d\u000afrom fieldwork trips in Cape Breton in the 1970s \u000d\u000aand \u201980s. He remembered, \u201cI found the older \u000d\u000apeople, the Gaelic speakers, had a beautiful social \u000d\u000astyle. You could visit people you didn\u2019t know and \u000d\u000awithin a few minutes you were relaxed. They were \u000d\u000avery easy to be with. They were accommodating in \u000d\u000aways that, to me, were unusual, and they were \u000d\u000agenerous that way, too . . . you would go in with \u000d\u000anothing, you would go in with empty pockets, and \u000d\u000ayou came out feeling like a million dollars.\u201d \u000d\u000aYou can hear something of that easy social style, \u000d\u000athe rapt attention and the lively fun, in many of the \u000d\u000aarchive recordings made during that time. We can \u000d\u000amarvel at the skillful memories of those recorded, \u000d\u000abut John is also impressed by the adult learners in \u000d\u000aNova Scotia who have dedicated their time to \u000d\u000aapprenticeship programs such as Bun is B\u00e0rr and \u000d\u000aare building their own capacities for absorbing \u000d\u000aand retaining stories and songs. He commented \u000d\u000ahow, \u201cPeople are coming up with songs of twenty \u000d\u000averses now which they understand, they \u000d\u000aunderstand what they\u2019re about and feel them \u000d\u000abecause they\u2019re part of a much larger experience.\u201d\u000d\u000aAn n\u00ec nach cluinn cluas, cha ghluais cridhe\u000d\u000aWhat the ear doesn\u2019t hear won\u2019t move the heart\u000d\u000a32","Dr. John Shaw, Frances MacEachen & Lili Watson\u000d\u000aGaelic singer and archivist, Mary Jane Lamond, \u000d\u000aembodies the kind of collective growth which has \u000d\u000abeen taking place in Nova Scotia in recent decades. \u000d\u000aShe learned Gaelic to fluency as a young adult and \u000d\u000ahas gone on to record six albums featuring songs \u000d\u000ashe learned from tradition-bearers in their \u000d\u000akitchens, or by listening to their recorded voices. \u000d\u000aIn her conversation with Shannon MacMullin in \u000d\u000aSeason 4, Session 1, Mary Jane returned many \u000d\u000atimes to the theme of learning and what the \u000d\u000aprocess of listening diligently and attentively to \u000d\u000aGaelic archive recordings has taught her. She \u000d\u000arecalled the effort she went to to seek out these \u000d\u000arecordings before they were available online, \u000d\u000amaking the trek to the Nova Scotia Archives in \u000d\u000aHalifax with a copy of Gaelic Songs of Nova Scotia\u000d\u000ato listen to the cassette tapes in the Helen \u000d\u000aCreighton Collection. She felt she was in over her \u000d\u000ahead, like she knew nothing, but she loved the \u000d\u000avoices: \u201cI could feel the joy that they had in singing, \u000d\u000awhat that was physically doing to them.\u201d\u000d\u000aWhen it came to learning to speak Gaelic, both \u000d\u000aMary Jane and Shannon commented on how \u000d\u000ainvaluable the archive recordings have been for \u000d\u000athem, and how listening to them became a social \u000d\u000aprocess as they gathered with friends for listening \u000d\u000aparties. Shannon described how these were like a \u000d\u000afrolic \u201cconnecting back and decoding what\u2019s in \u000d\u000athose songs.\u201d Mary Jane felt that the voices were \u000d\u000a\u201creaching out to us and giving us a visit, in a way.\u201d\u000d\u000aHome now after more than two decades touring as \u000d\u000aa professional musician, for the past seven years \u000d\u000aMary Jane has been a key member of the team \u000d\u000abehind the Cainnt is Ceathramhan | Language and \u000d\u000aLyrics project, directed by Dr. Heather Sparling at \u000d\u000aCape Breton University. The project has created an \u000d\u000aindex of the Gaelic songs made or known in Nova \u000d\u000aScotia, and is preparing to release a re-catalogued \u000d\u000aand transcribed database of the Cape Breton \u000d\u000aGaelic Folklore Collection, collected by Dr. John \u000d\u000aShaw. \u000d\u000aPondering the subject of memory, Mary Jane \u000d\u000amarveled at how the Cape Breton Gaelic Folklore\u000d\u000aCollection is made up of over 2,000 recordings \u000d\u000afrom around 250 informants, with most of the \u000d\u000arecordings coming from just 54 individuals. As an \u000d\u000aexample of these Gaels\u2019 incredible recall, she told \u000d\u000aus of a visit with her neighbour Seonaidh Aonghais \u000d\u000aBhig | Johnny Williams where Johnny had sung \u000d\u000aperfectly several verses of the complex song Cead \u000d\u000aDeireannach nam Beann (composed by \u000d\u000aDonnchadh B\u00e0n Mac an t-Saoir) despite only \u000d\u000ahearing the song a couple of times in his life, aged \u000d\u000a13. Mary Jane also pointed out, though, that many \u000d\u000atradition bearers practiced their story-telling and \u000d\u000asinging in private to hone their craft, and she \u000d\u000aexpressed an intention to reinstate a more regular \u000d\u000apractice in her own daily life as well.\u000d\u000aAs projects like Cainnt is Ceathramhan, Tobar an \u000d\u000aDualchais and DASG develop more accessible \u000d\u000afinding aides and transcriptions to help people \u000d\u000aaccess the archives, the possibilities expand for \u000d\u000amore listening frolics, quiet digital visits and the \u000d\u000amemorization and sharing of songs, stories and \u000d\u000alore. This will hopefully prompt other, perhaps \u000d\u000adormant, memories to rise to the surface as well. \u000d\u000aAs John said, \u201cIf a lot of people are coming together \u000d\u000aand concentrating on a tradition, they are going to \u000d\u000aremember a lot that is buried in their own minds \u000d\u000afrom their families.\u201d This becomes a way to honour \u000d\u000athe legacies of those who came before us, the \u000d\u000apeople for whom, as Stacey noted, there are no \u000d\u000amonuments. As one participant commented, \u201cWe \u000d\u000aare their monuments when we remember.\u201d We \u000d\u000aneed only put on headphones and press the play \u000d\u000abutton to know they are still singing with us.\u000d\u000a33","Amber Buchanan, Stacey MacLean & Mary Jane Lamond listening to \u000d\u000aarchive recordings [image credit: Heather Sparling]\u000d\u000aRemembering how far we\u2019ve come\u000d\u000aYou don\u2019t need to go very far back in time to reach \u000d\u000aa period when Gaelic was spoken as a first \u000d\u000alanguage in communities throughout Cape Breton \u000d\u000aand much of mainland Nova Scotia. The last \u000d\u000ahundred years have brought monumental changes \u000d\u000aand taken away many of those first-language \u000d\u000aGaelic-speakers. Much of their knowledge has\u000d\u000aslipped away with them, and the feeling of loss is \u000d\u000apalpable. Participants spoke of the heavy sadness \u000d\u000ait brings, a sort of cianalas | homesickness for a \u000d\u000aplace forever just out of reach. And yet, much as \u000d\u000awe might lament the passing of time, there are \u000d\u000asignificant achievements from the last century \u000d\u000awhich deserve to be celebrated as well. \u000d\u000aThe tireless work of legions of Gaelic advocates\u000d\u000ahave brought us a long way. As K.C. Beaton \u000d\u000areflected in Season 3, Session 4, \u201c25 years ago I \u000d\u000aremember sitting in a meeting with a government \u000d\u000aminister who openly scoffed at us for wanting to \u000d\u000ado anything about Gaelic development in Nova \u000d\u000aScotia. Now there\u2019s a government minister for \u000d\u000aGaelic Affairs!\u201d\u000d\u000aIt can be easy to yearn for the past\u2014the days when \u000d\u000apeople routinely entertained each other in the \u000d\u000ataigh c\u00e9ilidh and helped each other out with the \u000d\u000ahay. In Season 2, Session 2, Mary Jane remembered \u000d\u000avisiting Peter Jack MacLean and wishing she could \u000d\u000ago back to the era of his youth when the Gaelic \u000d\u000alanguage and culture seemed so much stronger. \u000d\u000aWhen she told him that, though, she said that Peter \u000d\u000aJack smiled and said evenly, \u201cAh yes, but penicillin \u000d\u000ais pretty good agus tha mi gu math measail air an \u000d\u000atelephone! | I\u2019m pretty fond of the telephone!\u201d If \u000d\u000anostalgia is a way of wrapping our arms round the \u000d\u000apast, then perhaps Peter Jack was reminding us to \u000d\u000adraw realism and gratitude of the present into the \u000d\u000aembrace as well.\u000d\u000aKeeping the basket full\u000d\u000aM\u00e0iri ni'n Alasdair Bhig Alasdair \u00d2ig | Mary \u000d\u000aMacKinnon often used to remark, \u201cBha an t-seann \u000d\u000afheadhainn riamh math dha ch\u00e9ile. | The old people \u000d\u000awere always good to each other.\u201d She lived her life \u000d\u000aby this principle and eventually took her place \u000d\u000aamong those kind-hearted elders. Her daily baking \u000d\u000ameant she was always ready to welcome visitors \u000d\u000afor a c\u00e9ilidh. It is a simple but profound kind of \u000d\u000agenerosity to be always thinking about who might \u000d\u000awalk through your door, and to be ready to offer \u000d\u000athem nourishment and conversation.\u000d\u000aWhen Mary died, she left the chest-freezer full of \u000d\u000atreats and biscuits, and her words of love and \u000d\u000ahospitality echoing in the memory of all who knew \u000d\u000aher. When we think now of what future \u000d\u000agenerations will need, what they will be glad we \u000d\u000akept, created and handed down to them, the task \u000d\u000acan feel daunting. But the many stories shared \u000d\u000athrough Air Ch\u00e9ilidh, remind us of the riches we \u000d\u000ashare, the strength we can access when we \u000d\u000asupport one another, and all the possibilities \u000d\u000awhich are before us.
